## Content

Understanding plant-microbe interactions requires examination of root exudation under nutrient stress using standardized and reproducible experimental systems. We grew Brachypodium distachyon hydroponically in fabricated ecosystem devices (EcoFAB 2.0) under three inorganic nitrogen forms (nitrate, ammonium, and ammonium nitrate), followed by nitrogen starvation. Analyses of exudates with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, biomass, medium pH, and nitrogen uptake showed EcoFAB 2.0's low intratreatment data variability. Furthermore, the three inorganic nitrogen forms caused differential exudation, generalized by abundant amino acids-peptides and alkaloids. Comparatively, nitrogen deficiency decreased nitrogen-containing compounds but increased shikimates-phenylpropanoids. Subsequent bioassays with two shikimates-phenylpropanoids (shikimic and p-coumaric acids) on soil bacteria or Brachypodium seedlings revealed their distinct capacity to regulate both bacterial and plant growth. Our results suggest that (i) Brachypodium alters exudation in response to nitrogen status, which can affect rhizobacterial growth, and (ii) EcoFAB 2.0 is a valuable standardized plant research tool.
