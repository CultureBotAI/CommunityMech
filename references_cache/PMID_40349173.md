Anthropogenic perturbations to the nitrogen cycle, primarily through use of 
synthetic fertilizers, is driving an unprecedented increase in the emission of 
nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas and an ozone depleting substance, 
causing urgency in identifying the sources and sinks of N2O. Microbial 
denitrification is a primary contributor to biotic production of N2O in anoxic 
regions of soil, marine systems, and wastewater treatment facilities. Here, 
through comprehensive genome analysis, we show that pathway partitioning is a 
ubiquitous mechanism of complete denitrification within microbial communities. 
We have investigated mechanisms and consequences of process partitioning of 
denitrification through detailed physiological characterization and kinetic 
modeling of a synthetic community of Rhodanobacter thiooxydans FW510-R12 and 
Acidovorax sp. GW101-3H11. We have discovered that these two bacterial isolates, 
from a heavily nitrate (NO3-) contaminated superfund site, complete 
denitrification through the exchange of nitrite (NO2-) and nitric oxide (NO). 
The process partitioning of denitrification and other processes, including amino 
acid metabolism, contribute to increased cooperativity within this denitrifying 
community. We demonstrate that certain contexts, such as high NO3-, cause 
unbalanced growth of community members, due to differences in their substrate 
utilization kinetics. The altered growth characteristics of community members 
drives accumulation of toxic NO2-, which disrupts denitrification causing N2O 
off gassing.
