Microbial colonization of plant roots involves strong selective pressures that 
shape the structure and function of root-associated communities. In particular, 
the endosphere represents a highly selective environment requiring host entry 
and in planta persistence. However, strain-specific microbial traits that enable 
endosphere colonization remain poorly understood. Here, we use a defined, 
genome-resolved community of 28 Variovorax strains isolated from the roots of 
Populus deltoides and Populus trichocarpa (poplar trees) to determine which 
strains partition between rhizosphere and endosphere compartments and to 
identify the genomic traits associated with endosphere specialization. By 
combining strain-resolved metagenomic profiling, comparative genomics, and 
functional assays, we demonstrate that dominant endosphere colonizers are 
enriched in genes related to nutrient metabolism, redox balance, transcriptional 
regulation, and a conserved L-fucose utilization pathway experimentally shown to 
enhance root colonization. Not all strains succeed through the same strategy. 
Community-wide functional profiling revealed a distinct and reduced set of 
traits in the endosphere, including orthogroups associated with low-abundance 
strains that were overlooked in strain-level analyses. These findings reveal 
that multiple ecological strategies, such as metabolic competition, regulatory 
adaptation, and niche specialization, can support endosphere colonization. Our 
results advance the understanding of how bacterial colonization traits are 
distributed and deployed within a plant microbiome and suggest that host 
filtering selects for distinct, and sometimes complementary, microbial 
strategies. This work supports a shift toward mechanistic, genome-resolved 
models of microbiome assembly and offers a framework for linking microbial 
function to host colonization success. IMPORTANCE

Plants often depend on diverse 
microbial partners to support their growth, resilience, and adaptation to 
changing environments. Among these microbes, some bacteria inhabit the 
rhizosphere (the narrow zone around roots where microbes interact with the 
plant) while others are able to enter and persist within root tissues. The 
traits that distinguish these two lifestyles remain poorly understood. In this 
study, we examined a group of related Variovorax strains from poplar tree root 
microbiomes to ask why some rhizosphere-associated strains also become 
successful endosphere colonizers. We found that strains appear to succeed 
through different strategies: some may benefit from rapid growth on 
plant-derived carbon sources, while others may rely on stress tolerance or 
fine-tuned regulation. These results suggest that there is no single path from 
the rhizosphere into the root interior, but rather multiple strategies shaped by 
the host environment. Understanding this diversity can inform efforts to design 
resilient plant-microbe communities.
