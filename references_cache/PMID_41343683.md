The BioModels Repository contains over 1000 manually curated mechanistic models 
from published literature, most often encoded in the Systems Biology Markup 
Language (SBML). This community-based standard formally specifies each model, 
but does not describe the computational experimental conditions to run a 
simulation and collect data. Therefore, it can be challenging to reproduce any 
figure or result from a publication with an SBML model alone. The Simulation 
Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) provides a solution: a standard 
way to specify exactly how to run an experiment corresponding to a specific 
figure or result. BioModels was established years before SED-ML, and both 
systems evolved over time, both in content and acceptance. Hence, only about 
half of the entries in BioModels contained SED-ML files, and these files 
reflected the version of SED-ML that was available at the time. Additionally, 
almost all of these SED-ML files had at least one minor mistake that made them 
impossible to run. To make these models and their results more reproducible, we 
report here on our work updating, correcting and generating new SED-ML files for 
1055 curated mechanistic models in BioModels. In addition, because SED-ML is 
implementation-independent, it can be used for verification, demonstrating that 
results hold across multiple simulation engines. We tested, corrected, and 
improved over 450 existing SED-ML files in the BioModels database, and created 
basic files for the rest of the entries. Then, we used a wrapper architecture 
for interpreting SED-ML, and report verification results across five different 
ODE-based biosimulation engines, after further improving the models, the 
wrappers, and the engines themselves. Our work with SED-ML and the BioModels 
collection aims to improve the utility of these models by making them more 
reproducible and credible. Improved reproducibility means these models are now 
even more fit for re-use, such as in new investigations and as components of 
multiscale models.
