In numerous contexts, individuals may decide whether they take actions to 
mitigate the spread of disease, or not. Mitigating the spread of disease 
requires an individual to change their routine behaviours to benefit others, 
resulting in a 'disease dilemma' similar to the seminal prisoner's dilemma. In 
the classical prisoner's dilemma, evolutionary game dynamics predict that all 
individuals evolve to 'defect.' We have discovered that when the rate of 
cooperation within a population is directly linked to the rate of spread of the 
disease, cooperation evolves under certain conditions. For diseases which do not 
confer immunity to recovered individuals, if the time scale at which individuals 
receive accurate information regarding the disease is sufficiently rapid 
compared to the time scale at which the disease spreads, then cooperation 
emerges. Moreover, in the limit as mitigation measures become increasingly 
effective, the disease can be controlled; the number of infections tends to 
zero. It has been suggested that disease spreading models may also describe 
social and group dynamics, indicating that this mechanism for the evolution of 
cooperation may also apply in those contexts.
