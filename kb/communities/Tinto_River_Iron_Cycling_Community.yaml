name: Tinto River Iron Cycling Community
description: 'A natural acidic iron-cycling microbial community from the Rio Tinto River in southwestern Spain, distinguished
  by exceptional eukaryotic diversity (>65% of total biomass) in an extremely acidic environment (mean pH 2.2). While prokaryotic
  diversity is low with 80% of bacteria belonging to three iron-cycling genera (Leptospirillum, Acidithiobacillus, Acidiphilium),
  eukaryotic diversity is remarkably high including algae (diatoms, Chlorophyta, Euglenozoa, Rhodophyta), fungi (Hortaea,
  Acidomyces), and diverse protists (ciliates, amoebae, heliozoans, cercomonads, stramenopiles). The river has constant acidic
  pH (mean 2.2, range 1.0-2.5) and high metal concentrations (Fe 2.3 g/L, Cu 0.11 g/L, Zn 0.22 g/L) throughout its 100 km
  length, driven by natural oxidation of massive sulfide deposits in the Iberian Pyrite Belt. The prokaryotic community drives
  iron cycling through Fe²⁺ oxidation (Leptospirillum, Acidithiobacillus) and heterotrophic carbon cycling (Acidiphilium),
  creating stromatolite-like iron oxide precipitates. Eukaryotes contribute primary production (photosynthetic algae), heterotrophic
  consumption (protists, fungi), and trophic structure (ciliate predators, heliozoan top predators). The ecosystem represents
  a natural analog for early Earth conditions and extraterrestrial iron-rich acidic environments, supporting astrobiology
  research. Rio Tinto demonstrates that complex food webs with eukaryotic dominance can thrive in extreme acid-metal conditions,
  challenging assumptions about habitability limits.

    the Iberian Pyrite Belt with massive sulfide ore deposits. The river exhibits constant acidic pH (mean 2.2, range 1.0-2.5)
    maintained by natural pyrite oxidation, not active mining. High metal concentrations include Fe (2.3 g/L), Cu (0.11 g/L),
    Zn (0.22 g/L). The river forms stromatolite-like iron oxide precipitates and supports complex microbial-eukaryotic communities
    despite extreme conditions. Temperature is temperate (15-25°C), oxygen-rich from surface flow.

      is an obligate chemolithoautotroph that oxidizes ferrous iron (Fe²⁺) to ferric iron (Fe³⁺) for energy, fixing CO₂ autotrophically.
      The organism thrives at pH 1.0-2.5 and contributes to iron oxide stromatolite formation through extracellular Fe³⁺ precipitation.
      Leptospirillum is highly specialized for iron oxidation and cannot utilize sulfur compounds, distinguishing it from
      Acidithiobacillus.
