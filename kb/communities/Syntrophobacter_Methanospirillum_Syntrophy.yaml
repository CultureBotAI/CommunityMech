name: Syntrophobacter-Methanospirillum Syntrophic Consortium
description: 'A syntrophic, obligate two-member anaerobic consortium consisting of Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans, which oxidizes
  propionate to acetate, and Methanospirillum hungatei, a hydrogen and formate-utilizing methanogen. S. fumaroxidans degrades
  propionate via the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway only in coculture with H2/formate-using archaea, as it uses protons as the
  electron acceptor with H2 and formate as electron sink products. The removal of H2 and formate by M. hungatei is thermodynamically
  essential for continued propionate oxidation by S. fumaroxidans. This syntrophic relationship is fundamental to understanding
  methane production from propionate in anaerobic environments such as digesters, sediments, and wastewater treatment systems,
  playing a critical role in biogeochemical cycling.

- name: Propionate Oxidation and H2/Formate Production
  description: 'Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans oxidizes propionate to acetate via the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway, using protons
    as the electron acceptor and producing H2 and formate as electron sink products. This propionate oxidation is thermodynamically
    unfavorable under standard conditions and only proceeds when H2 and formate partial pressures are kept extremely low by
    a syntrophic partner. Formate dehydrogenase Fdh1 and hydrogenase Hox are the main confurcating enzymes used for energy
    conservation, while periplasmic Fdh2 and hydrogenase Hyn play an important role in reverse electron transport.
