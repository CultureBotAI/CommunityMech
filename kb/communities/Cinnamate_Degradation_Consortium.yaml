name: Cinnamate β-Oxidation Consortium
description: 'A syntrophic 3-member anaerobic consortium for degradation of cinnamate via β-oxidation to benzoate, consisting
  of Papillibacter cinnamivorans, Syntrophus sp., and Methanobacterium formicicum. P. cinnamivorans performs β-oxidation of
  cinnamate to benzoate, followed by syntrophic benzoate degradation by Syntrophus sp. to acetate, H2, and CO2, with the methanogen
  consuming H2 to produce methane. This stepwise aromatic compound degradation pathway is important for anaerobic bioremediation.
