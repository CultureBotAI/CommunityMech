name: Wheat Synthetic Consortium C1
description: 'A synthetic 3-member rhizosphere consortium (C1) for biocontrol of soilborne fungal pathogens in wheat. The
  consortium consists of Cupriavidus campinensis B20, Asticcacaulis sp. B27, and an additional rhizosphere isolate. Together,
  these bacteria suppress Rhizoctonia solani AG8 through production of antimicrobial compounds, volatile organic compounds,
  and induced systemic resistance in wheat plants, providing effective biological control for sustainable agriculture.
