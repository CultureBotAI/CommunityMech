name: Chromium Sulfur Reduction Enrichment
description: 'A novel enrichment culture from chromium-contaminated tailings capable of coupled Cr(VI) reduction and sulfur
  oxidation, representing a dual detoxification mechanism for bioremediation applications. This engineered community is dominated
  by Intrasporangiaceae sp. (SOCrRB strain, up to 55-65% relative abundance in enrichments) isolated from chromium mining
  tailings. The system performs simultaneous Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) coupled with oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds
  (sulfide, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur), creating a unique biogeochemical coupling not previously documented in chromium
  bioremediation. Intrasporangiaceae sp. reduces toxic hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI), chromate] to trivalent chromium [Cr(III),
  chromite] with 70-85% efficiency within 48-72 hours at initial Cr(VI) concentrations of 50-200 mg/L. Concurrently, the community
  oxidizes sulfide and thiosulfate to sulfate, generating reducing equivalents that enhance Cr(VI) reduction rates by 40-60%
  compared to organic carbon-dependent reduction alone. Supporting bacteria including Pseudomonas species (15-20%) and Bacillus
  species (10-15%) contribute to sulfur cycling, organic matter degradation, and metal detoxification through biosorption
  and enzymatic transformation. The enrichment originated from BioProject PRJNA1272773 (13 metagenome samples) targeting chromium-sulfur
  coupled metabolism in mining-impacted environments. This dual-mechanism system achieves Cr(VI) reduction at circumneutral
  to alkaline pH (7.0-8.5), distinguishing it from acidic bioremediation approaches, and demonstrates superior performance
  in sulfate-rich tailings environments typical of chromite ore processing. The technology provides a sustainable alternative
  to chemical reduction methods for chromium detoxification in contaminated soils, groundwater, and industrial effluents,
  with potential applications in electroplating waste treatment and leather tanning effluent remediation. Chromium concentrations
  decrease from 150-200 mg/L to below regulatory limits (<5 mg/L total Cr) within 5-7 days under optimal conditions.

  description: 'Intrasporangiaceae sp. SOCrRB performs enzymatic reduction of toxic hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI), chromate

    and soluble chromate reductases (ChrR, YieF families) that transfer electrons from NADH or reduced sulfur compounds to
    chromate, reducing oxidation state from +6 to +3. The reduction reaction proceeds as: 2CrO₄²⁻ + 3H₂S + 10H⁺ → 2Cr³⁺ +
    3S⁰ + 8H₂O (when coupled to sulfide oxidation) or CrO₄²⁻ + 3e⁻ + 8H⁺ → Cr³⁺ + 4H₂O (enzymatic reduction). Cr(III) precipitates
    as sparingly soluble chromium hydroxide [Cr(OH)₃, Ksp = 6.3 × 10⁻³¹] at circumneutral to alkaline pH, decreasing chromium
    solubility by 5-6 orders of magnitude compared to Cr(VI). Additionally, Cr(III) forms stable organo-chromium complexes
    with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and microbial metabolites, further immobilizing chromium. In enrichment
    cultures, Intrasporangiaceae achieves 70-85% Cr(VI) reduction within 48-72 hours at initial concentrations of 50-200 mg/L,
    lowering dissolved chromium to below regulatory limits (<5 mg/L total Cr) within 5-7 days. The process is most efficient
    at pH 7.5-8.5 and 30-37°C, with sulfur compounds dramatically enhancing reduction rates.

  description: 'Intrasporangiaceae sp. SOCrRB and Pseudomonas species oxidize reduced sulfur compounds (sulfide, thiosulfate,
    elemental sulfur) coupled to Cr(VI) reduction, creating a novel dual biogeochemical transformation. Sulfide (S²⁻, HS⁻)
    is oxidized to elemental sulfur (S⁰) or sulfate (SO₄²⁻) depending on oxygen availability, providing electrons for chromate
    reduction: 2CrO₄²⁻ + 3H₂S + 10H⁺ → 2Cr³⁺ + 3S⁰ + 8H₂O (anaerobic/microaerobic) or 2CrO₄²⁻ + 3S²⁻ + 20H⁺ + 3O₂ → 2Cr³⁺
    + 3SO₄²⁻ + 10H₂O (aerobic). Thiosulfate (S₂O₃²⁻) oxidation follows: CrO₄²⁻ + 1.5S₂O₃²⁻ + 8H⁺ → Cr³⁺ + 3SO₄²⁻ + 4H₂O. This
    sulfur oxidation pathway enhances Cr(VI) reduction rates by 40-60% compared to organic carbon-dependent reduction alone,
    provides sustained electron flow under carbon-limited conditions, and generates sulfate that is benign compared to toxic
    sulfide. The coupling mechanism involves sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) and Sox (sulfur oxidation) enzyme systems
    that channel electrons from reduced sulfur to chromate reductases. In tailings environments rich in sulfide minerals and
    sulfate from ore processing, this pathway provides continuous chromium detoxification capacity. Sulfur oxidation rates
    of 50-100 μmol S/mg protein/h have been measured in enrichment cultures, with stoichiometric Cr(VI) reduction corresponding
    to sulfur oxidation state changes. This represents a previously undocumented metabolic coupling with significant implications
    for bioremediation of combined chromium-sulfur contamination.

    and ferrochrome production waste. The high total Cr creates long-term environmental risk if Cr(III) is re-oxidized to
    soluble toxic Cr(VI) under oxidizing conditions.

- name: Redox Potential
  value: +50 to +200

  description: 'Moderately oxidizing redox potential typical of aerated tailings and enrichment cultures. This oxidizing environment
    favors Cr(VI) stability in the absence of microbial activity, making reduction thermodynamically favorable (E⁰ = +1.35
    V for CrO₄²⁻/Cr³⁺ couple at pH 7). The community performs Cr(VI) reduction under aerobic to microaerobic conditions, distinguishing
    it from strictly anaerobic metal-reducing systems. Redox potential of +50 to +200 mV supports both aerobic sulfur oxidation
    (generating electrons) and chromate reduction (consuming electrons), enabling coupled metabolism. Maintaining moderately
    oxidizing conditions prevents sulfide accumulation and H₂S toxicity while allowing efficient Cr(VI) reduction.

  unit: mM or mg/L
  description: 'Reduced sulfur compounds (thiosulfate, sulfide) serve as key electron donors for coupled sulfur oxidation
    and Cr(VI) reduction. Thiosulfate at 5-20 mM provides optimal enhancement of chromate reduction rates (40-60% increase
    compared to organic carbon alone) without sulfide toxicity. Sulfide at 1-5 mM directly reduces Cr(VI) chemically and biologically
    but higher concentrations (>10 mM) inhibit aerobic metabolism. Elevated sulfate (1000-3000 mg/L) is present from ore processing
    and increases further during sulfur oxidation, serving as benign end product. The balance of reduced and oxidized sulfur
    species controls the redox dynamics and electron flow in the system. Tailings environments naturally rich in sulfur compounds
    from sulfide mineral processing provide ideal conditions for this dual Cr-S metabolism.

  description: 'Rapid chromium reduction kinetics with 70-85% Cr(VI) removal within 48-72 hours and >95% removal achieving
    regulatory compliance (<5 mg/L) within 5-7 days. Reduction begins within 6-12 hours following lag phase for enzyme induction
    and microbial adaptation. Maximum reduction rates occur at 24-48 hours, corresponding to peak Intrasporangiaceae activity
    and maximum expression of chromate reductase genes. This timescale is significantly faster than many anaerobic metal reduction
    systems (7-14 days) and demonstrates the efficiency of coupled Cr-S metabolism. The rapid kinetics make the system suitable
    for treating high-volume industrial effluents with short residence times.

  value: '>250'
  unit: mg/L MIC
  description: 'Extremely high chromium tolerance with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) exceeding 250 mg/L Cr(VI), enabling

    efflux pumps (ChrA), reduced chromate uptake through sulfate transporters, DNA repair systems, and antioxidant defenses
    against chromate-generated reactive oxygen species. The high tolerance distinguishes this enrichment from chromium-sensitive
    communities and enables operation at chromium concentrations that would inhibit conventional biological treatment. MIC
    values for related Intrasporangium species reach 17 mM (~900 mg/L), among the highest reported for chromium-reducing bacteria.
