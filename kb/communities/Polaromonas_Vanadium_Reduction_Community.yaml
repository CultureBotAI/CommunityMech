name: Polaromonas Vanadium Reduction Community
description: 'A microbial community from vanadium mine tailings in northern China capable of reducing toxic soluble vanadate
  [V(V)] to less soluble vanadyl [V(IV)], facilitating vanadium detoxification and immobilization. This community is dominated
  by Polaromonas species (Burkholderiaceae family, up to 46% relative abundance in tailings) that perform dissimilatory V(V)
  reduction using genes homologous to iron and metal reduction pathways (cymA, omcA, narG). The tailings harbor diverse metal-reducing
  bacteria including sulfate reducers (Desulfovibrio, Desulfitobacterium) and iron-reducing Proteobacteria (Geobacter-related
  organisms) that contribute to reductive immobilization of vanadium and co-occurring metals. V(V) reduction to V(IV) decreases
  vanadium solubility by 2-3 orders of magnitude, transforming mobile vanadate into sparingly soluble vanadyl species and
  V(IV)-containing minerals. The community is enriched from highly contaminated mine tailings with total vanadium concentrations
  reaching 10,500 mg/kg and bioavailable V(V) at 15-25 mg/L in pore water. Under anaerobic conditions with electron donors
  (lactate, acetate, hydrogen), the community achieves 60-85% V(V) reduction within 7-14 days. Genes encoding c-type cytochromes
  (cymA, omcA), nitrate reductases (narG, napA), and arsenate reductases (arrA) mediate V(V) reduction through outer membrane
  electron transfer pathways. This represents the first demonstration of microbial V(V) reduction in circumneutral pH mine
  tailings, providing a biological approach for vanadium immobilization and mine remediation. The system is particularly relevant
  for emerging vanadium contamination from steel production, petroleum processing, and vanadium redox flow battery manufacturing.

  description: 'Polaromonas species perform dissimilatory vanadate [V(V)] reduction to vanadyl [V(IV)] as a respiratory process,
    coupling oxidation of organic electron donors (lactate, acetate, pyruvate) to V(V) reduction. The process is mediated
    by c-type cytochromes (cymA, omcA genes) that transfer electrons from the inner membrane quinone pool to outer membrane
    terminal reductases (narG-like nitrate reductases, arrA-like arsenate reductases) capable of reducing V(V). Soluble vanadate
    (VO₄³⁻, oxidation state +5) is reduced to vanadyl cation (VO²⁺, oxidation state +4), decreasing vanadium solubility by
    2-3 orders of magnitude. V(IV) precipitates as hydrated vanadyl hydroxides, oxides, or co-precipitates with iron minerals.
    In tailings microcosms, Polaromonas achieves 65-80% V(V) reduction within 7-14 days, lowering dissolved vanadium from
    15-25 mg/L to 3-8 mg/L. This represents the dominant vanadium immobilization pathway in the community. The reaction is
    thermodynamically favorable (standard potential E⁰ +0.34 V for VO₂⁺/VO₄³⁻ couple) and generates energy for microbial growth,
    with cell yields increasing proportionally to V(V) reduced.

    hydrated vanadyl hydroxides [VO(OH)₂], vanadyl sulfates, and V(IV)-substituted iron oxides. Solubility decreases from

    (XAS) analysis confirms V(IV) accumulation in tailings solids following microbial reduction, with V(IV) comprising 65-85%
    of total vanadium in reduced zones. The precipitates are stable under reducing conditions (Eh < -100 mV) but can re-oxidize
    to soluble V(V) if oxygen penetrates the tailings. Long-term immobilization requires maintaining anaerobic conditions
    through organic carbon amendment or physical capping. This process represents the key mechanism for natural attenuation

  description: 'Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria (Desulfovibrio, Desulfitobacterium) chemically
    reduces V(V) to V(IV) through abiotic reactions, complementing enzymatic microbial reduction. The reaction proceeds as:
    VO₄³⁻ + H₂S + 2H⁺ → VO²⁺ + S⁰ + 2H₂O, consuming sulfide and generating elemental sulfur or sulfate depending on oxygen
    availability. Sulfide concentrations of 50-200 µM in tailings pore water accelerate V(V) reduction rates by 40-60% compared
    to microbial reduction alone. Additionally, sulfide precipitates vanadium as vanadium sulfide minerals (V₂S₃, V₃S₄) with
    extremely low solubility (Ksp ~ 10⁻²⁰), providing superior long-term immobilization compared to vanadyl oxides. Sulfate
    reduction is particularly important in deeper, more reduced tailings zones where sulfate concentrations (500-2000 mg/L
    from ore processing) are elevated. This chemical pathway operates continuously in sulfidogenic zones, providing persistent
    V(V) reduction capacity independent of direct microbial activity.

  description: 'The microbial community performs sequential reduction of Fe(III) followed by V(V), reflecting thermodynamic

    goethite, hematite) present in vanadium titanomagnetite tailings, generating Fe(II) and lowering redox potential from
    +200 mV to -50 to -150 mV. This Fe(III) reduction phase (days 0-5 in microcosms) creates strongly reducing conditions
    favorable for subsequent V(V) reduction. After Fe(III) depletion or decline to low concentrations, V(V) becomes the dominant
    terminal electron acceptor (days 5-14), with V(V) reduction rates increasing 3-5 fold. Fe(II) generated during Fe(III)
    reduction can also chemically reduce V(V) at mineral surfaces, particularly on magnetite and maghemite. The sequential
    reduction pattern mirrors that observed in uranium bioremediation systems, where Fe(III) reduction precedes U(VI) reduction.
    This metabolic succession is driven by thermodynamics (Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ E⁰ = +0.77 V; VO₂⁺/VO₄³⁻ E⁰ = +0.34 V at pH 7), with

    V(IV) against re-oxidation. Maintaining Eh < -100 mV is critical for long-term vanadium immobilization. Redox potential
    correlates inversely with V(V) reduction rates (R² = -0.82) and positively with V(IV) stability.

  description: 'Organic electron donors supplied to stimulate dissimilatory V(V) reduction. Lactate is the preferred substrate
    for Polaromonas and Desulfovibrio, oxidized to acetate and CO₂ coupled to V(V), Fe(III), or sulfate reduction. Acetate
    serves as electron donor for Geobacter and some Desulfovibrio strains. Optimal lactate concentrations (10-15 mM) support
    70-85% V(V) reduction within 7-10 days. Higher concentrations (>25 mM) can inhibit sulfate reducers through organic acid
    toxicity. Alternative electron donors including glucose, molasses, and hydrogen have been tested, with lactate providing
    highest V(V) reduction rates. Field applications may use cheaper carbon sources like agricultural waste or vegetable oil
    emulsions for sustained electron donor release.

  description: 'Ambient temperature range in mine tailings, varying seasonally and with depth. This mesophilic range is optimal
    for Polaromonas (psychrotolerant, optimum 18-25°C), Geobacter (optimum 25-30°C), and Desulfovibrio (optimum 25-35°C).
    V(V) reduction rates increase 2-3 fold from 15°C to 25°C, following typical microbial temperature response (Q₁₀ ≈ 2-2.5).
    Winter temperatures (<10°C) slow but do not eliminate V(V) reduction, with Polaromonas remaining active at 4-8°C due to
    psychrotolerance. Temperature optimization is less critical than redox and pH control for field remediation.

- name: Time to V(V) Reduction
  value: 7-14
  unit: days
  description: 'Time required to achieve 60-85% V(V) reduction in tailings microcosms and laboratory cultures. Reduction begins
    within 2-3 days following lag phase for microbial growth and adaptation. Maximum reduction rates occur at days 5-10, corresponding
    to peak Polaromonas abundance and maximum expression of metal reductase genes (cymA, omcA). By day 14, V(V) concentrations
    plateau at 3-8 mg/L, representing equilibrium between ongoing reduction and slow V(IV) re-oxidation by residual oxidants.
    Extended incubation (>21 days) does not significantly improve removal. This timescale is comparable to Fe(III) reduction
    (3-7 days) but faster than complete sulfate reduction (14-28 days), suggesting V(V) serves as preferred electron acceptor
    after Fe(III) depletion.

  description: 'Elevated sulfate concentrations in tailings pore water, derived from sulfide mineral (pyrite, pyrrhotite)
    oxidation during ore processing and weathering. Sulfate serves as electron acceptor for Desulfovibrio and other sulfate-reducing
    bacteria, generating hydrogen sulfide that chemically reduces V(V) and precipitates vanadium as sulfide minerals. High
    sulfate supports robust sulfate-reducing populations (8-12% of community). However, excessive sulfate (>3000 mg/L) can
    competitively inhibit V(V) reduction by preferentially consuming electron donors. Optimal sulfate concentrations (800-1500
    mg/L) balance sulfate reduction for sulfide generation with preservation of electron donors for direct V(V) reduction.
