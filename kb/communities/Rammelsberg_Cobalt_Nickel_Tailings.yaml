name: Rammelsberg Cobalt-Nickel Tailings Consortium
description: 'A mesophilic acidophilic bacterial consortium applied to bioleach cobalt, copper, and other valuable metals
  from sulfidic mine tailings at the Rammelsberg polymetallic massive sulfide deposit in the Harz Mountains, Germany. This
  consortium represents one of the only industrial-scale cobalt bioleaching processes globally and demonstrates exceptional
  efficiency in recovering critical battery materials from low-grade mine tailings. The adapted microbial community consists
  mainly of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (iron-oxidizing) and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans (sulfur-oxidizing), achieving
  91% cobalt and 57% copper extraction from bulk tailings (Co 0.02%, Cu 0.12%) after 13 days in stirred tank reactors at 10%
  pulp density. The consortium exhibits synergistic cooperation between iron and sulfur oxidizers, where iron oxidation by
  At. ferrooxidans generates ferric iron that chemically oxidizes sulfide minerals, while sulfur oxidation by At. thiooxidans
  prevents elemental sulfur passivation and maintains low pH through sulfuric acid production. Mineralogical analysis revealed
  that cobalt occurs on the surface of framboidal pyrite and is mobilized through microbial attack. This system demonstrates
  the biotechnological potential for recovering critical materials (cobalt, copper, nickel) from mine waste through environmentally
  sustainable bioprocessing, addressing both resource recovery and mine tailings remediation challenges relevant to the circular
  economy and battery supply chains.

    acid, maintaining the low pH (pH 1.5-2.5) required for ferric iron solubility and optimal acidophilic bacterial activity.
    Removal of the elemental sulfur passivation layer is essential for sustained bioleaching kinetics, as sulfur accumulation
    would otherwise block access of ferric iron and bacteria to fresh mineral surfaces. At. thiooxidans employs the sox system
    (soxAX, soxB, soxCD, soxYZ), sulfide oxidoreductase (SQR), and sulfur dioxygenase (SDO) to catalyze sulfur oxidation.
    The sulfuric acid produced lowers pH, solubilizes additional metals through acid leaching, and creates the extreme acidic
    environment that excludes neutrophilic competitors, maintaining consortium dominance. This sulfur-oxidizing function is
    synergistic with At. ferrooxidans iron oxidation, as the two organisms together prevent both ferric hydroxide precipitation
    (through low pH) and sulfur passivation.
