name: MAMC-M48 Lignocellulose-Degrading Consortium
description: 'A minimal active microbial consortium (MAMC-M48) for lignocellulose degradation, optimized through reductive
  screening from 18 candidate strains. The 5-member consortium consists of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia JN40, Paenibacillus
  sp. PALXIL05, Microbacterium sp. UYFA68, Chryseobacterium taiwanense DUCC3723, and Brevundimonas sp. R3. Enriched from soil
  bacteria on sugarcane waste, this synthetic community achieves 50.6% degradation of all lignocellulose fractions, reaching
  96.5% of the degradation rate observed with the full 18-species pool, demonstrating high efficiency with minimal complexity.
