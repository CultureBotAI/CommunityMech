name: E-waste Bioleaching Consortium
description: 'An engineered acidophilic microbial consortium adapted for recovering valuable metals from electronic waste,
  particularly printed circuit boards (PCBs). This consortium consists primarily of iron-oxidizing bacteria dominated by Leptospirillum
  ferriphilum with Sulfobacillus benefaciens, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans contributing
  to metal solubilization. The community operates at extremely low pH (1.2 ± 0.1) and moderate temperature (35°C), oxidizing
  ferrous iron to generate ferric iron (Fe³⁺) that dissolves base metals (copper, zinc, nickel) and mobilizes precious metals
  (gold, silver, palladium) from PCB components. Metal recovery is exceptional: 100% copper dissolution (2.6-4.2 g/L), 100%
  zinc (303-543 mg/L), and 70% nickel (30-52 mg/L). However, PCB materials are toxic to the consortium, delaying the pre-oxidation
  phase from 11 days at 1% PCB load to 18 days at 2% load, with no growth above 8% PCB. Successive subculturing adapts the
  consortium to PCB toxicity, reducing lag phase by 2.6-fold. This biotechnological approach offers an environmentally-friendly
  alternative to pyrometallurgical e-waste processing (smelting), avoiding toxic emissions while recovering critical materials
  including copper for electrical applications and precious metals for electronics manufacturing. The two-step process may
  include subsequent cyanide-producing heterotrophs (Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. putida) for enhanced gold and silver extraction.

  description: 'Leptospirillum ferriphilum, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, and A. ferrivorans oxidize ferrous iron (Fe²⁺)
    to ferric iron (Fe³⁺) at extremely low pH (1.2). The generated Fe³⁺ serves as the primary oxidant for dissolving copper
    and other base metals from printed circuit boards. Copper dissolution follows: Cu⁰ + 2Fe³⁺ + 4H⁺ → Cu²⁺ + 2Fe²⁺ + 2H₂O
    (for metallic copper) and CuFeS₂ + 4Fe³⁺ → Cu²⁺ + 5Fe²⁺ + 2S⁰ (for copper sulfide phases). The process achieves 100% copper
    dissolution, yielding 2.6-4.2 g/L depending on PCB load (1-2% w/v). The consortium also dissolves zinc (100% yield, 303-543
    mg/L), nickel (70% yield, 30-52 mg/L), and mobilizes precious metals (Au, Ag, Pd). Iron oxidizers must overcome PCB toxicity,
    with adapted cultures reducing the pre-oxidation lag from 11 days (1% PCB) to shorter durations through successive subculturing.

    or selection of resistant subpopulations. This demonstrates microbial resilience and evolutionary responses to anthropogenic
