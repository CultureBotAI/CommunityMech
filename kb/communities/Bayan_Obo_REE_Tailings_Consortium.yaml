name: Bayan Obo REE Tailings Consortium
description: 'An acid-producing bacterial consortium engineered to extract rare earth elements (REE) from tailings at the
  Bayan Obo mine in Inner Mongolia, China, the world''s largest rare earth deposit. This functional bacterial consortium achieves
  exceptional REE recovery rates of 82-83% for the five main light rare earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) after 18 days
  of bioleaching using one-step or two-step processes. The tailings are iron extraction residues from medium-poor oxidized
  ores containing bastnaesite (REE(CO₃)F) and monazite as primary REE minerals. The consortium employs acid-producing bacteria
  including actinomycetes (Streptomyces sp.), autotrophic acidophiles (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans), and heterotrophic
  acidophiles (Acidiphilium cryptum) that work synergistically to mobilize REE through acidolysis and organic acid complexation.
  Key mechanisms include production of organic acids (citric, oxalic, lactic, pyruvic), siderophores, and complexing ligands
  that solubilize REE from carbonate-fluoride minerals. The two-step process (sequential inoculation with heterotrophs followed
  by autotrophs) achieves 83.51% recovery versus 82.78% for one-step (simultaneous inoculation), demonstrating synergistic
  enhancement through pH control and organic acid accumulation. This system represents a critical sustainable biotechnology
  for recovering strategic REE materials essential for clean energy technologies, permanent magnets, and electronics while
  remediating millions of tons of existing Bayan Obo tailings.

  notes: 'Rare-earth-rich tailings (RERT) from Bayan Obo mine, Inner Mongolia, China, the world''s largest REE deposit. Tailings
    are iron extraction residues obtained from 15 million tons of medium-poor oxidized ores after pre-enrichment, hydrogen
    mineral phase transformation, and milling processes. Primary REE minerals are bastnaesite (REE(CO₃)F, dominated by Ce,
    La) and monazite (REE-phosphate). The tailings contain five main light rare earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) that are
    targeted for bioleaching recovery. The Bayan Obo deposit represents a strategic global REE resource, and bioleaching of
    accumulated tailings offers dual benefits of critical material recovery and environmental remediation of legacy mining

  description: 'Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans oxidizes ferrous iron and reduced sulfur compounds to generate sulfuric acid,
    lowering the pH of the tailings slurry to acidic conditions (pH 1.5-2.5) that facilitate REE dissolution from bastnaesite
    (REE(CO₃)F) and monazite minerals. The acidification reaction involves iron oxidation (4Fe²⁺ + O₂ + 4H⁺ → 4Fe³⁺ + 2H₂O)
    coupled to proton production, and sulfur oxidation (S²⁻ + 2H₂O + 2O₂ → SO₄²⁻ + 4H⁺) producing sulfuric acid. Low pH is
    critical for protonating carbonate groups in bastnaesite, destabilizing the mineral structure and releasing REE cations.
    The autotrophic acid generation by At. ferrooxidans provides the primary acidolysis mechanism, while the organism''s ability
    to grow chemolithotrophically on inorganic substrates eliminates the need for organic carbon supplements, reducing operational
    costs.
