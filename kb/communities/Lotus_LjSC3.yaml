name: Lotus Lj-SC3 Synthetic Community
description: 'A 16-member synthetic community (Lj-SC3) derived from Lotus japonicus roots and nodules, designed to study host
  preference and community assembly dynamics in legume-microbe interactions. The community represents bacterial families from
  the Lj-SPHERE culture collection, including nitrogen-fixing symbionts from Rhizobiaceae and Phyllobacteriaceae families,
  as well as commensal bacteria from Burkholderiaceae, Oxalobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Microbacteriaceae. This community
  exhibits host preference when co-inoculated with Arabidopsis-derived strains, preferentially colonizing Lotus roots in a
  community context. The SC3 community enables investigation of nitrogen fixation, nodulation, priority effects during microbiota
  assembly, and bacterial invasiveness in the rhizosphere.

  objective: Study host preference and assembly dynamics with the Lotus japonicus Lj-SC3 synthetic community derived from Lj-SPHERE root and nodule isolates.
  assembly_strategy: Bottom-up assembly from cultured Lj-SPHERE isolates; the source study defines a 16-member community, and this record currently curates 10 representative taxa.
  measurement_endpoints:
  - Interaction-level mechanistic characterization
  - Member-level abundance and persistence tracking
  notes: Backfilled engineering-design metadata from existing curation; refine with protocol-level parameters when available.
  perturbation_design: 'Designed condition space included: Host plant species, Nodulation status.'
