name: MSC-1 Dominant Core
description: 'A naturally evolved dominant core subset of the Model Soil Consortium-1 (MSC-1) containing 13 bacterial species
  from arid grassland soil. This stable consortium was enriched through serial dilution and passaging on chitin as the primary
  carbon source. The core members include representatives from Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, with key
  species including Rhodococcus sp., Dyadobacter sp., Taibaiella sp., Bosea sp., and Streptomyces sp. The consortium exhibits
  cooperative chitin degradation and nitrogen mineralization functions essential for soil carbon and nitrogen cycling.
