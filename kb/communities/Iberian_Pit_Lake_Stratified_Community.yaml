name: Iberian Pit Lake Stratified Community
description: 'A permanently stratified (meromictic) acidic pit lake community from the Iberian Pyrite Belt in southwestern
  Spain/Portugal, distinguished by dramatic vertical metabolic zonation and subsurface anaerobic processes in an extreme acid
  mine drainage environment. The pit lake ecosystem exhibits three distinct layers: an upper oxic mixolimnion (pH 2.2-3.1,
  0-3m depth), a chemocline transition zone (11m), and an anoxic monimolimnion (pH 3.0-4.5, 35m depth). The upper layer is
  dominated by acidophilic green algae (Coccomyxa onubensis) and heterotrophic bacteria (Acidiphilium), while the chemocline
  hosts intense sulfate reduction and iron cycling by specialized Proteobacteria (Desulfomonile, Candidatus Acidulodesulfobacterium).
  The deep anoxic layer harbors archaeal heterotrophs (Thermoplasmatales, 46% of sequences) that scavenge organic carbon and
  perform sulfide oxidation using trace oxygen, along with iron-reducing bacteria (Geobacter) and subsurface methanogens (Methanobrevibacter,
  Methanospirillum). The permanent stratification creates steep geochemical gradients with iron concentrations increasing
  from 2 mM Fe³⁺ in surface waters to 113 mM Fe²⁺ at depth, sulfate ranging from 26-126 mM, and oxygen transitioning from
  oxic to completely anoxic conditions. This system represents a natural laboratory for studying coupled aerobic-anaerobic
  metabolism, metal cycling, biosulfidogenesis, and subsurface methanogenesis under polyextreme conditions (acidity, metals,
  anoxia). The Iberian Pyrite Belt pit lakes demonstrate how microbial stratification can support complex biogeochemical cycling
  and potential natural attenuation of toxic metals through sulfide precipitation.

  description: 'The pit lake exhibits vertical iron redox zonation with Fe²⁺ oxidation in oxic upper layers and chemocline,
    and Fe³⁺ reduction in the anoxic deep layer. In the chemocline, Leptospirillum, Acidithiobacillus, and Ferrovum oxidize
    Fe²⁺ (rising from deep layer) to Fe³⁺ using oxygen and nitrate as electron acceptors, generating energy for autotrophic
    CO₂ fixation. These iron oxidizers express high levels of iron oxidation genes (TPM > 1000), creating the redox boundary
    that defines the chemocline. The resulting Fe³⁺ precipitates as iron oxides or settles to the deep layer where Geobacter
    and other anaerobes reduce Fe³⁺ back to Fe²⁺ using organic carbon. This "cryptic iron cycling" on settling minerals couples
    upper layer autotrophy to deep layer heterotrophy, with iron serving as an electron shuttle between oxic and anoxic zones.
    Iron concentrations increase dramatically with depth (2 mM surface to 113 mM at 35m), creating a large reservoir of electron
    acceptors/donors. Photoreduction of Fe³⁺ by Coccomyxa in surface waters also contributes Fe²⁺ for oxidation. The continuous
    iron cycling maintains redox gradients essential for supporting diverse metabolic guilds.

    as insoluble metal sulfides. The SRB express abundant sulfate reduction genes (aprAB, sat, dsrAB, qmoABC at TPM > 1000),
    reducing sulfate (26-126 mM) to sulfide with peak H₂S concentration of 120 µM at the chemocline. The sulfide immediately
    reacts with dissolved metals to form copper sulfide (covellite, CuS), zinc sulfide (wurtzite, ZnS), and arsenic sulfide
    (realgar, AsS), removing these toxicants from solution. This biosulfidogenesis provides natural attenuation of acid mine
    drainage, creating a barrier that prevents metal migration between layers. The organic carbon for sulfate reduction comes
    from settling Coccomyxa biomass and dissolved organics, linking primary production to metal remediation. However, sulfide
    oxidation by Thermoplasmatales and other organisms in the deep layer using trace oxygen partially reverses this process,
    creating a dynamic sulfur cycle. The balance between sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation determines net metal precipitation

    (80-90 µM) and methanogen abundance (0.018% of reads) are low compared to neutral pH systems, their presence demonstrates
    that methanogenesis can occur in polyextreme environments combining acidity, high metals, and anoxia. Methanogens likely
    occupy microniches in sediments, biofilms, or mineral surfaces where local pH neutralization by carbonate dissolution
    or ammonia production creates habitable refugia. The low methanogenesis rates suggest that sulfate reduction (with 26-126
    mM sulfate available) outcompetes methanogenesis for H₂ and acetate, as sulfate reducers have thermodynamic and kinetic
    advantages. Gene expression analysis detected hydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase genes but diagnostic methyl-coenzyme

    and heterotrophs. Nevertheless, subsurface methanogenesis represents an important process in stratified acidic systems

  unit: pH units
  description: 'The anoxic monimolimnion (35m depth) exhibits less extreme pH than surface waters due to sulfate reduction
    (consuming H⁺), metal sulfide precipitation (releasing OH⁻), and carbonate buffering. This pH gradient creates distinct
    ecological niches for surface vs. subsurface acidophiles.

  value: Oxic to anoxic
  unit: stratification gradient
  description: 'Sharp oxygen gradient defines three layers: oxic mixolimnion (dissolved oxygen present, supporting aerobic
    iron and sulfur oxidizers), chemocline transition zone (steep oxygen gradient, ~11m depth, 2m thick), and anoxic monimolimnion
    (no measurable oxygen, supporting anaerobes). Trace nanomolar oxygen (<10⁻⁵ M) penetrates deep layer, enabling cryptic
    sulfide oxidation by Thermoplasmatales. The permanent anoxia in deep waters permits sulfate reduction and methanogenesis.

  unit: mM Fe
  description: 'Dramatic vertical iron gradient with surface waters containing ~2 mM Fe (predominantly Fe³⁺ from oxidation)
    increasing to 17-113 mM Fe at depth (predominantly Fe²⁺ from reduction). This 50-fold concentration increase reflects
    iron accumulation in the permanently stratified monimolimnion where Fe³⁺ reduction exceeds reoxidation. The high Fe²⁺
    reservoir provides substrate for iron-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs when it diffuses upward to the chemocline.

  description: 'High sulfate concentrations throughout water column (26 mM in upper layer, 41-126 mM in deep layer) from pyrite
    (FeS₂) oxidation provide abundant electron acceptor for sulfate-reducing bacteria. The 5-fold sulfate increase with depth
    indicates sulfate accumulation from ongoing pyrite oxidation exceeds sulfate reduction, though biosulfidogenesis actively
    consumes sulfate in the chemocline (peak H₂S 120 µM). This sulfate reservoir drives the sulfur biogeochemical cycle and
    metal precipitation.

  value: Meromictic
  unit: lake type
  description: 'The pit lake exhibits permanent chemical and thermal stratification (meromixis) with no seasonal or interannual
    mixing events. Temperature differences between surface and bottom reach 15°C, and density gradients from dissolved salts
    prevent turnover. This permanent stratification allows establishment of distinct microbial communities in each layer,
    accumulation of nutrients and metals at depth (phosphate 0.26 µM → 32 µM, nitrogen 8.2 µM → 33 µM), and maintenance of
    steep geochemical gradients essential for coupled redox processes. The stable chemocline (~11m) persists as a biogeochemical
    hotspot for iron oxidation, sulfate reduction, and metal precipitation.

    oxic layer to 119-167 ASVs in the chemocline and 192-206 ASVs in the deep anoxic layer. This counterintuitive pattern
    (higher diversity in more extreme conditions) reflects niche diversification in the heterogeneous anoxic environment where
    multiple anaerobic metabolisms (fermentation, sulfate reduction, Fe³⁺ reduction, methanogenesis) coexist, and microniches
    on settling particles or minerals support specialist populations.
