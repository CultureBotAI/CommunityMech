name: Aspergillus Indium LED Recovery Platform
description: 'An engineered fungal monoculture bioplatform based on Aspergillus niger for sustainable recovery of indium from
  waste liquid crystal display (LCD) and light-emitting diode (LED) panels through indirect bioleaching. This system represents
  a green alternative to conventional harsh chemical extraction methods (concentrated acids at high temperatures), utilizing
  fungal organic acid production to mobilize and recover critical materials from electronic waste. A. niger produces a cocktail
  of organic acids including oxalic acid (14.9 g/L), gluconic acid (1.2 g/L), citric acid (0.9 g/L), and malic acid (0.39
  g/L) during growth on glucose-based medium. The spent culture filtrate achieves remarkable indium recovery performance:
  100% indium yield from waste LCD/LED panels in just 1.5 hours at 70°C, with final indium concentration of 145.6 mg/L. The
  bioleaching mechanism involves H+ ions from acidic functional groups (-COOH) of organic acids and secreted proteins, which
  dissolve indium-tin oxide (ITO) coatings and indium-bearing components. The process operates at low pH (1.96) due to organic
  acid accumulation, creating optimal conditions for indium mobilization while avoiding the corrosivity, energy intensity,
  and hazardous waste generation of conventional acid leaching. This biotechnological approach addresses the critical need
  for indium recycling, as this element is essential for touchscreens, flat-panel displays, and optoelectronics, yet faces
  supply constraints due to limited primary resources and increasing demand from electronics manufacturing.

    notes: 'Filamentous fungus widely used in industrial biotechnology for organic acid production, now adapted for critical
      materials recovery from electronic waste. A. niger is a GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) organism with extensive
      industrial history in citric acid fermentation, enzyme production, and bioprocessing applications. This saprophytic
      ascomycete fungus secretes a diverse array of organic acids during aerobic growth on carbohydrate substrates, including
      oxalic acid (14.9 ± 0.7 g/L), gluconic acid (1.2 ± 0.02 g/L), citric acid (0.9 ± 0.05 g/L), and malic acid (0.39 ± 0.01
      g/L). The organic acid cocktail acidifies the medium to pH 1.96 and provides carboxylic acid functional groups (-COOH)
      that serve as proton donors for metal dissolution. In the indium recovery platform, A. niger is cultivated for 7 days
      at 30°C on glucose-based medium (100 g/L glucose, 5 g/L yeast extract), then the biomass is removed by filtration to
      obtain cell-free spent medium (CFSM) containing the organic acids and secreted proteins. This CFSM serves as the bioleaching
      agent, achieving 100% indium yield from waste LCD/LED panels in 1.5 hours at 70°C and 1% pulp density. The mechanism
      involves H+ from acidic functional groups dissolving indium-tin oxide (ITO) coatings: In₂O₃ + 6H+ → 2In³⁺ + 3H₂O. Oxalic
      acid is the dominant acid (14.9 g/L), providing strong chelation of In³⁺ cations through bidentate coordination, preventing
      precipitation and maintaining solubility. The platform demonstrates A. niger''s versatility beyond traditional fermentation,
      adapting natural organic acid metabolism for urban mining and circular economy applications in critical materials supply

  description: 'Aspergillus niger produces a complex mixture of organic acids during aerobic fermentation on glucose-based
    medium (100 g/L glucose, 5 g/L yeast extract). After 7 days of cultivation at 30°C and 150 rpm, the spent culture filtrate
    (CFSM) contains oxalic acid (14.9 ± 0.7 g/L), gluconic acid (1.2 ± 0.02 g/L), citric acid (0.9 ± 0.05 g/L), and malic
    acid (0.39 ± 0.01 g/L). Oxalic acid is the dominant component at 82% of total organic acids, providing both acidification
    (pH 1.96) and metal chelation capability through its two carboxylic acid groups. The organic acid accumulation occurs
    through overflow metabolism when carbon substrate (glucose) is abundant relative to nitrogen and phosphate, leading to
    excretion of citric acid cycle intermediates (citrate, malate) and alternative acids (oxalate, gluconate). These secreted
    organic acids serve as the bioleaching agents when the cell-free spent medium contacts crushed LCD/LED waste panels. The
    carboxylic acid functional groups (-COOH) dissociate to release H+ ions that protonate and dissolve indium-tin oxide (ITO,
    In₂O₃-SnO₂) coatings: In₂O₃ + 6H+ → 2In³⁺ + 3H₂O. Additionally, the deprotonated carboxylate anions (COO-) chelate dissolved
    In³⁺ cations, forming stable soluble complexes such as indium-oxalate [In(C₂O₄)₂]- that prevent precipitation and maintain
    high indium concentrations (145.6 mg/L) in solution. This dual mechanism of acid-mediated dissolution and chelator-stabilized
    solubilization enables quantitative indium recovery (100% yield) under mild conditions compared to conventional harsh

    (typically 90% In₂O₃ and 10% SnO₂) deposited as a thin film on glass substrates for touchscreens, flat-panel displays,
    and optoelectronics. The bioleaching reaction proceeds through protonation by H+ ions from organic acid carboxyl groups:
    In₂O₃ + 6H+ → 2In³⁺ + 3H₂O and SnO₂ + 4H+ → Sn⁴⁺ + 2H₂O. The process achieves 100% indium yield from LCD/LED waste in

    the primary leaching agent, providing both acidity (pH 1.96) and chelation through formation of indium-oxalate complexes
    [In(C₂O₄)₂]- and [In(C₂O₄)₃]³⁻. These soluble complexes prevent precipitation of In³⁺ as hydroxides or phosphates and
    enable quantitative recovery. The optimal temperature (70°C) enhances dissolution kinetics and oxalate complexation equilibria
    while remaining below organic acid decomposition thresholds. This indirect bioleaching approach (using cell-free spent
    medium rather than live fungus) avoids metal toxicity to microorganisms and enables high-temperature operation incompatible
    with biological activity. The recovered indium solution can be further processed by solvent extraction, ion exchange,
    or electrowinning to obtain metallic indium or indium salts for recycling into new ITO coatings or other high-tech applications.

  description: 'Dissolved indium cations (In³⁺) form stable soluble coordination complexes with oxalate anions (C₂O₄²⁻) in
    the bioleaching solution, preventing precipitation and enabling high indium concentrations. Oxalate is a bidentate chelating
    ligand that coordinates In³⁺ through both carboxylate oxygen atoms, forming ring structures with high thermodynamic stability.
    The predominant complexes are [In(C₂O₄)₂]- and [In(C₂O₄)₃]³⁻, which remain highly soluble across the pH range of the bioleaching
    system (pH 1.96). The oxalate concentration (14.9 g/L, 165 mM) provides large excess relative to indium (145.6 mg/L, 1.3
    mM), ensuring complete complexation and preventing hydrolysis to insoluble In(OH)₃ precipitate. This chelation mechanism
    is critical for maintaining quantitative indium recovery (100% yield) and enabling downstream processing. The indium-oxalate
    complexes can be selectively precipitated by pH adjustment (raising pH to neutralize excess oxalic acid and destabilize
    complexes), extracted by ion exchange resins, or separated by solvent extraction for purification. The selectivity of
    oxalate complexation favors In³⁺ over competing cations (Ca²⁺, Fe³⁺, Al³⁺) present in LCD/LED waste, contributing to high
    purity of recovered indium. This represents a green chemistry approach to critical materials recovery, replacing conventional
    toxic extractants (organophosphorus compounds, amines) with biodegradable organic acids produced by fungal fermentation.

    A. niger secretes a diverse extracellular proteome during growth, including cellulases, hemicellulases, proteases, and

    donate protons to oxide surfaces. The contribution of proteins to bioleaching acidity is secondary to organic acids but
    represents an additional mechanism enhancing indium mobilization. The protein component also may serve as biosurfactants,
    reducing surface tension at the solid-liquid interface and improving contact between leaching solution and ITO-coated
    LCD/LED particles. This multi-component bioleaching system (organic acids + proteins) demonstrates the complexity and

  unit: mg/L
  description: 'Final indium concentration of 145.6 ± 0.4 mg/L in bioleaching solution after complete dissolution from 1%
    LCD/LED waste pulp. This concentration represents economically viable indium recovery, as the leachate can be directly
    processed by downstream purification methods (solvent extraction, ion exchange, precipitation, electrowinning) to obtain
    metallic indium or high-purity indium salts. The 145.6 mg/L concentration is maintained in solution through oxalate complexation,
    preventing precipitation losses.

  value: Indirect bioleaching (two-step)
  description: 'The platform employs indirect bioleaching where A. niger is first cultivated separately to produce organic
    acids (step 1: fermentation at 30°C, 7 days), then the cell-free spent medium is used to leach indium from LCD/LED waste
    (step 2: bioleaching at 70°C, 1.5 hours). This two-step configuration avoids metal toxicity to the fungus, enables high-temperature
    leaching incompatible with biological activity, and simplifies biomass separation. The indirect approach contrasts with
    direct bioleaching where live microorganisms contact metal-bearing substrates, which would inhibit fungal growth due to
    indium toxicity. The two-step system optimizes each phase independently (fermentation vs. leaching) for maximum overall
    efficiency.

- name: Substrate Waste Composition
  value: LCD/LED panels (ITO-coated glass)
  description: 'The substrate consists of waste liquid crystal display (LCD) and light-emitting diode (LED) panels containing
    indium-tin oxide (ITO) transparent conductive coatings deposited on glass. ITO is the critical material for touchscreens,
    flat-panel displays, and optoelectronics due to its unique combination of electrical conductivity and optical transparency.
    The typical ITO composition is 90% In₂O₃ and 10% SnO₂, with indium content of 1-5% by weight in the overall panel. Global
    electronic waste generation exceeds 50 million tons annually, with LCD/LED panels representing a significant fraction
    containing recoverable indium. This urban mining approach addresses indium supply constraints (limited primary deposits,
    geopolitical concentration, increasing demand) and reduces environmental impacts of landfilling electronic waste.
