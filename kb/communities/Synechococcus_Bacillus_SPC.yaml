name: Synechococcus-Bacillus Synthetic Photosynthetic Consortium
description: 'A synthetic, light-driven consortium pairing the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (engineered
  to secrete sucrose via the cscB+ transporter) with Bacillus subtilis 168. The cyanobacterium fixes CO2 and exports sucrose,
  which supports heterotrophic growth of B. subtilis. This modular platform demonstrates a stable photosynthetic co-culture
  for sustainable carbon cycling.
