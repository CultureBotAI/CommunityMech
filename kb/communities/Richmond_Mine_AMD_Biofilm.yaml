name: Richmond Mine AMD Biofilm
description: 'A thick, subaerial biofilm community from the Richmond Mine at Iron Mountain, California, representing one of
  the most extreme acid mine drainage (AMD) environments on Earth. This predominantly lithotrophic biofilm thrives at extraordinarily
  low pH (0.5-1.0) with temperatures ranging from 30-50°C and metal ion concentrations in the decagrams per liter range. The
  community is dominated by iron-oxidizing bacteria (Leptospirillum spp.) and archaea (Ferroplasma acidarmanus) that drive
  pyrite dissolution through ferric iron generation. Leptospirillum group II comprises 71% of detected clones, with Ferroplasma
  reaching up to 85% of cells in highly acidic microniches. The biofilm also contains nitrogen-fixing Leptospirillum group
  III (L. ferrodiazotrophum), making it a keystone species in this nitrogen-limited ecosystem. Ultra-small ARMAN archaea (Micrarchaeota
  and Parvarchaeota) with genome sizes ~1 Mb represent novel lineages found at 5-25% relative abundance. The community oxidizes
  approximately 1-2 × 10⁵ moles of pyrite per day, generating extreme acidity and solubilizing metals including iron (up to
  24 g/L), zinc (several g/L), and copper (hundreds mg/L). This natural biofilm serves as a model system for understanding
  microbial life at pH extremes and has implications for biomining, bioremediation, and astrobiology.

    oxidation, generating sulfuric acid and solubilizing metals. Temperatures range from 30-50°C at sampling sites and exceed
    56°C deeper in the mine. Metal concentrations reach decagrams per liter, creating one of Earth''s most extreme habitats.

  unit: moles pyrite/day
  description: 'The microbial community oxidizes approximately 1-2 × 10⁵ moles of pyrite per day, demonstrating the massive
    biogeochemical impact of this biofilm system. This oxidation generates sulfuric acid (lowering pH), releases metals (increasing
    toxicity), and produces ferrous iron (providing substrate for microbial energy generation). The scale of mineral dissolution
    rivals industrial biomining operations.

- name: Oxygen Availability
  value: Aerobic to microaerobic
  unit: qualitative
  description: 'The subaerial biofilm forms at the air-solution interface, providing access to atmospheric oxygen. Oxygen
    serves as the terminal electron acceptor for iron oxidation by Leptospirillum and aerobic respiration by ARMAN archaea.
    However, microaerobic niches exist within the biofilm where Ferroplasma thrives and where anaerobic deltaproteobacteria
    have been detected unexpectedly. The biofilm''s thick structure (~1 cm) creates oxygen gradients from aerobic surfaces
    to potentially anaerobic depths.
