  objective: BioModels record MODEL2310020001 is a host-microbiota metaorganism model that links a merged microbiota model to host organ models (brain, liver, and colon) through a shared bloodstream compartment.
  assembly_strategy: Engineered community configuration represented from published model and experimental context.
  measurement_endpoints:
  - Community composition and functional performance readouts
  notes: Backfilled engineering-design metadata from existing curation; refine with protocol-level parameters when available.
