name: Syntrophus Benzoate Degrader
description: >
  A syntrophic, obligate two-member anaerobic consortium consisting of Syntrophus aciditrophicus SB,
  which degrades benzoate and other aromatic compounds to acetate and H2/formate, and
  Methanospirillum hungatei, a hydrogen-utilizing methanogen. S. aciditrophicus degrades benzoate
  only in coculture with H2-using microorganisms, as it uses protons as the electron acceptor
  with H2 and formate as electron sink products. The removal of H2 by M. hungatei is thermodynamically
  essential for continued benzoate degradation by S. aciditrophicus. This syntrophic relationship
  is important for understanding aromatic compound degradation and bioremediation in anaerobic
  environments such as sediments and contaminated aquifers.

ecological_interactions:
  - name: Benzoate Degradation and H2/Formate Production
    description: >
      Syntrophus aciditrophicus degrades benzoate (an aromatic compound) to acetate, using protons
      as the electron acceptor and producing H2 and formate as electron sink products. This benzoate
      degradation is thermodynamically unfavorable under standard conditions and only proceeds when
      H2 partial pressure is kept extremely low by a syntrophic partner. The organism senses aromatic
      compounds and is obligately dependent on syntrophic H2 removal for growth on benzoate. This
      capability is important for bioremediation of aromatic contaminants in anaerobic environments.

    description: >
      Methanospirillum hungatei consumes the H2 and formate produced by S. aciditrophicus, combining
      H2 with CO2 to produce methane via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. This H2 removal maintains
      a low H2 partial pressure, making the thermodynamically unfavorable benzoate degradation by
      S. aciditrophicus energetically feasible. This interspecies hydrogen transfer (IHT) enables
      the complete mineralization of benzoate to methane and CO2 in anaerobic environments.
