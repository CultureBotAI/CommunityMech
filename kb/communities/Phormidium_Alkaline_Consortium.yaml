name: Phormidium Alkaline Consortium
description: 'A natural cyanobacterial-heterotrophic consortium dominated by Candidatus Phormidium alkaliphilum, isolated
  from soda lakes. This consortium represents a robust, stable community optimized for carbon sequestration in high-pH environments
  (pH >11). The community includes 8-12 core members with 29 identified heterotrophic metagenome-assembled genomes spanning
  Bacteroidota, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Verrucomicrobiota, Patescibacteria, and Planctomycetota. The consortium
  demonstrated exceptional stability with 4 years of crash-free growth in laboratory culture, maintaining biomass productivity
  of 15.2 g/m²/day. Ecological interactions include carbon transfer from cyanobacteria to heterotrophs, nutrient remineralization,
  vitamin provision (B12, B1, B7), and functional niche partitioning that enhances community robustness. The consortium enables
  direct CO2 capture from air at alkaline pH, making it highly relevant for biotechnological carbon sequestration applications.
  Stable isotope probing with ¹³C-bicarbonate revealed tight coupling of carbon flux from primary production to heterotrophic
  populations, particularly Wenzhouxiangella species.

    Stable isotope probing with ¹³C-bicarbonate combined with proteomics revealed tight coupling of carbon flow from autotrophs
    to heterotrophs. The heterotrophic community utilizes six main ecological niches: (1) phototrophy using unused solar energy,
    (2) fermentation products (formate, acetate, lactate, ethanol, H₂), (3) compatible solutes released during osmotic stress,
    (4) storage compounds, (5) cell wall polysaccharides, and (6) dead cell biomass. Despite this carbon consumption, productivity
    losses to heterotrophs are relatively small compared to other photosynthetic losses.
