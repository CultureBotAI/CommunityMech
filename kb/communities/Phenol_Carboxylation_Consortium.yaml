name: Phenol Carboxylation Consortium
description: 'An obligate syntrophic 4-member consortium for anaerobic degradation of phenol via carboxylation to benzoate.
  The consortium consists of a short motile rod, a long non-motile rod, Desulfovibrio sp., and Methanospirillum sp. (methanogen).
  Under methanogenic conditions (N2/CO2), phenol is carboxylated to benzoate, which is then degraded to acetate, CH4, and
  CO2. The three bacterial types exhibit obligate syntrophic interdependence with the methanogen for complete aromatic pollutant
  mineralization.
