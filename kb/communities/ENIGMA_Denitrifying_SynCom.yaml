name: ENIGMA Denitrifying SynCom
description: >-
  A two-member denitrifying synthetic community from the ENIGMA program, composed of
  Rhodanobacter thiooxydans FW510-R12 and Acidovorax sp. GW101-3H11 isolated from a heavily
  nitrate-contaminated superfund site. The consortium exhibits pathway-partitioned denitrification
  via nitrite and nitric oxide exchange, with cooperativity that can be disrupted under high
  nitrate conditions leading to nitrite accumulation and nitrous oxide off-gassing.

engineering_design:
  objective: Resolve mechanisms and consequences of pathway-partitioned denitrification in a defined SynCom.
  assembly_strategy: Two-member bottom-up SynCom assembled from site isolates FW510-R12 and GW101-3H11.
  perturbation_design: High nitrate context was used to test destabilization of cooperative denitrification.
  measurement_endpoints:
  - Physiological growth and metabolite dynamics
  - Kinetic modeling of denitrification partitioning
  - Multi-omics readouts (transcriptome and proteome)
  notes: Design emphasizes exchange of nitrite and nitric oxide as partitioned pathway intermediates.
