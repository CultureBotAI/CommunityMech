name: Geobacter-Methanosarcina DIET Community
description: 'A syntrophic two-member consortium consisting of Geobacter metallireducens and Methanosarcina barkeri that performs
  direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) during ethanol oxidation. G. metallireducens oxidizes ethanol and transfers
  electrons directly to M. barkeri via electrically conductive pili (e-pili), bypassing the need for diffusible electron carriers
  like H2 or formate. M. barkeri uses these electrons to reduce CO2 to methane. This coculture forms aggregates and achieves
  stoichiometric conversion of ethanol to methane via DIET. Unlike hydrogen-mediated syntrophy, DIET relies on biological
  electrical connections between cells, with pili serving as conduits for long-range electron transfer. M. barkeri is unique
  as a methanogen capable of using either H2 or electrons from DIET for CO2 reduction, making it a model organism for studying
  electrical connections in microbial communities.

  description: 'Geobacter metallireducens oxidizes ethanol to acetate and CO2, transferring electrons directly to Methanosarcina
