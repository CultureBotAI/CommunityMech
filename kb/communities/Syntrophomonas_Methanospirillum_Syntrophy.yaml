name: Syntrophomonas-Methanospirillum Syntrophic Consortium
description: 'A syntrophic, obligate two-member anaerobic consortium consisting of Syntrophomonas wolfei, which β-oxidizes
  saturated fatty acids (butyrate through octanoate) to acetate, and Methanospirillum hungatei, a hydrogen-utilizing methanogen.
  S. wolfei degrades butyrate only in coculture with H2-using bacteria, as it uses protons as the electron acceptor with H2
  as the electron sink product. The removal of H2 by M. hungatei is thermodynamically essential for continued fatty acid oxidation
  by S. wolfei. This classic syntrophic relationship is fundamental to understanding methane production from fatty acids in
  anaerobic environments such as digesters, sediments, and the rumen.

- name: Butyrate Oxidation and H2 Production
  description: 'Syntrophomonas wolfei β-oxidizes butyrate (C4) to acetate, using protons as the electron acceptor and producing
    H2 as the electron sink product. This fatty acid β-oxidation is thermodynamically unfavorable under standard conditions
    and only proceeds when H2 partial pressure is kept extremely low by a syntrophic partner. The organism cannot utilize
    common electron acceptors (nitrate, sulfate, etc.) and is therefore obligately dependent on syntrophic H2 removal.
