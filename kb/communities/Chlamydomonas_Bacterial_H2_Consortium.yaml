name: Chlamydomonas-Bacterial Hydrogen Production Consortium
description: 'A synthetic algae-bacteria consortium for sustainable hydrogen production, composed of the green alga Chlamydomonas
  reinhardtii and three bacterial species: Microbacterium forte sp. nov., Bacillus cereus, and Stenotrophomonas goyi sp. nov.
  This mutualistic association produces up to 313 mL H2/L over 17 days in high-cell density cultures. M. forte is the primary
  bacterial species responsible for improving algal hydrogen production, while the complete bacterial community enhances and
  sustains photobiological H2 generation through metabolic cooperation.

  objective: Engineer a synthetic algae-bacteria consortium for sustainable hydrogen production using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with Microbacterium forte sp. nov., Bacillus cereus, and Stenotrophomonas goyi sp. nov.
  assembly_strategy: Bottom-up assembly from axenic Chlamydomonas reinhardtii co-cultured with three bacterial isolates selected from the naturally associated community.
  measurement_endpoints:
  - Interaction-level mechanistic characterization
  - Member-level abundance and persistence tracking
  notes: Backfilled engineering-design metadata from existing curation; refine with protocol-level parameters when available.
