name: SF356 Thermophilic Cellulose-Degrading Community
description: 'A stable thermophilic cellulose-degrading consortium (SF356) from composting systems, consisting of five bacterial
  strains: Clostridium straminisolvens CSK1, Clostridium sp. FG4, Pseudoxanthomonas sp. M1-3, Brevibacillus sp. M1-5, and
  Bordetella sp. M1-6. The community exhibits both functional and structural stability over 20 subcultures at 50°C. Synergistic
  interactions occur between the anaerobic cellulolytic Clostridium and aerobic bacteria, where aerobes create anaerobic conditions
  while receiving acetate and glucose from cellulose fermentation.
