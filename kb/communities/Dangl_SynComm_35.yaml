name: Jeff Dangl's SynComm 35
description: 'A 35-member synthetic community (SynComm 35) composed of genome-sequenced bacterial strains representing typical
  taxonomic diversity of Arabidopsis root commensals. This community was designed to interrogate plant immune responses, particularly
  pattern-triggered immunity (PTI/MTI). Of the 35 members, 10 are robust suppressors of MAMP-triggered immunity (flg22 response),
  13 are partial suppressors, and 11 are non-suppressors. The community includes 32 strains isolated from Brassicaceae roots
  (mainly Arabidopsis), 2 strains from unplanted soil, and E. coli DH5α as a control. SynComm 35 collectively suppresses specific
  transcriptional sectors of plant immunity, particularly WRKY transcription factors, receptor-like kinases, and secondary
  metabolite biosynthesis genes, while suppressors achieve enhanced colonization capacity.
