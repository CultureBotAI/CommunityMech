description: >-
  A 10-member synthetic bacterial community (PD10) assembled by the Oak Ridge National
  Laboratory Plant-Microbe Interfaces (PMI) team from Populus deltoides rhizosphere isolates.
  The community was used as a bottom-up model system to study assembly dynamics, medium-dependent
  community structure, metabolic exchange, and antagonistic interactions during stable community
  formation.
