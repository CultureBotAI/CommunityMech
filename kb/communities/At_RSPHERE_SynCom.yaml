name: At-RSPHERE SynCom
description: 'A synthetic bacterial community derived from the Arabidopsis root microbiota culture collection (At-RSPHERE),
  representing 16 bacterial families isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana roots grown in natural soil. This community was established
  to study plant-microbe interactions and their effects on plant productivity and carbon cycling in the rhizosphere. The consortium
  members were selected to represent a broad taxonomic range covering the major bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria,
  and Bacteroidetes) found in the Arabidopsis root microbiome. Assembly sizes vary from 5-20 members depending on experimental
  design, enabling reductionist studies of root microbiota assembly and function.

ecological_state: ENGINEERED
community_origin: ENGINEERED
community_category: RHIZOSPHERE
engineering_design:
  objective: Define Arabidopsis root-associated communities from the At-RSPHERE isolate collection for reductionist host-microbiome experiments.
  assembly_strategy: Bottom-up assembly from cultured Arabidopsis root isolates in At-RSPHERE; experiments use variable subset sizes (5 to 20 members), and this record currently curates a representative 6-taxon subset.
  measurement_endpoints:
  - Interaction-level mechanistic characterization
  - Member-level abundance and persistence tracking
  notes: Backfilled engineering-design metadata from existing curation; refine with protocol-level parameters when available.
  perturbation_design: 'Designed condition space included: Bacterial diversity, Assembly size.'
