name: Maize Root Simplified Bacterial Community
description: 'A representative 7-member bacterial community from maize rhizosphere, developed through selective iterations
  to model root-associated microbiome function. The community consists of Enterobacter cloacae AA4, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia
  AA1, Ochrobactrum pituitosum AA2, Herbaspirillum frisingense, Pseudomonas putida, Curtobacterium pusillum, and Chryseobacterium
  indologenes. This simplified community reproducibly assembles on root surfaces and provides biocontrol against Fusarium
  verticillioides, a phytopathogenic fungus. E. cloacae AA4 plays a keystone role, as its removal causes dramatic community
  composition changes.
