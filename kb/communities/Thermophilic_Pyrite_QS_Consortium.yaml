name: Thermophilic Pyrite Quorum Sensing Consortium
description: 'A moderately thermophilic three-species bioleaching consortium used to study the effects of quorum sensing (QS)
  signaling on pyrite and chalcopyrite dissolution. This acidophilic community consists of Leptospirillum ferriphilum DSM
  14647, Acidithiobacillus caldus DSM 8584, and Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans DSM 9293, operating at pH 2.0-2.5 and 40°C.
  The consortium demonstrates coordinated microbial behavior mediated by diffusible signal factor (DSF) and N-acyl-homoserine
  lactone (AHL) quorum sensing systems. Treatment with DSF-family compounds (DSF and BDSF at 2 μM each) reduced pyrite and
  chalcopyrite dissolution via inhibitory effects on iron oxidation and mineral colonization. DSF compounds induced A. caldus
  motility and dispersion from pyrite with concomitant expansion of L. ferriphilum on mineral surfaces, while AHL-mediated
  signaling (C12-AHL, C14-AHL, 3-OH-C12-AHL, 3-OH-C14-AHL at 5 μM each) repressed L. ferriphilum motility. The consortium
  was subjected to RNA-seq transcriptomics (12 samples, 271 Gbases) to elucidate gene expression changes in response to QS
  molecules (NCBI BioProject PRJNA1259591). This system represents the first comprehensive study of quorum sensing regulation
  in moderately thermophilic biomining bacteria, revealing that QS molecules change planktonic/mineral subpopulation distributions
  and modulate leaching efficiency through control of cell attachment and iron oxidation rates.

  description: 'Leptospirillum ferriphilum oxidizes ferrous iron [Fe(II)] to ferric iron [Fe(III)] as the primary energy source
    for chemolithoautotrophic growth at 40°C and pH 2.0-2.5. The organism uses Fe²⁺ as electron donor, generating reducing
    equivalents for CO₂ fixation through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Fe³⁺ production provides the oxidant necessary for
    pyrite (FeS₂) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂) dissolution. This iron oxidation activity is subject to quorum sensing regulation
    through DSF and AHL signaling systems. Treatment with DSF compounds caused L. ferriphilum to expand populations on mineral
    surfaces, increasing contact with Fe²⁺ substrate released from mineral dissolution. Conversely, AHL quorum sensing signals
    repressed L. ferriphilum motility, potentially stabilizing biofilm formation. The QS-mediated control of iron oxidation
    represents a coordinated mechanism for regulating mineral dissolution rates based on population density and community
    composition. DSF treatment reduced overall pyrite and chalcopyrite dissolution via inhibitory effects on iron oxidation,
    demonstrating that QS signals can modulate bioleaching efficiency.

    bioleaching by continuously generating protons. Sulfur oxidation follows: S⁰ + 1.5O₂ + H₂O → H₂SO₄. The sulfuric acid
    protonates mineral surfaces, enhancing Fe³⁺ attack and preventing precipitation of iron hydroxides. A. caldus exhibits
    QS-mediated control of mineral colonization patterns. Treatment with DSF compounds induced A. caldus motility and dispersion
    from pyrite surfaces, reducing mineral-attached populations and increasing planktonic cells. This DSF-induced detachment
    may represent a coordinated mechanism for redistributing cells between mineral colonization and planktonic growth modes.
    The organism prevents accumulation of passivating sulfur layers that would block mineral-microbe contact. QS regulation
    of A. caldus sulfur oxidation activity contributes to overall modulation of bioleaching efficiency, with DSF treatment
    reducing chalcopyrite and pyrite dissolution rates.

    L. ferriphilum colonization on minerals. This reciprocal species redistribution suggests DSF signaling coordinates niche
    partitioning, with A. caldus adopting planktonic lifestyle while L. ferriphilum increases biofilm formation. DSF compounds
    reduced overall pyrite and chalcopyrite dissolution through inhibitory effects on iron oxidation, indicating that high
    population density signals (via DSF accumulation) downregulate mineral attack. This may represent a density-dependent
    feedback mechanism preventing overexploitation of mineral resources or managing oxidative stress from excessive Fe³⁺ generation.
    DSF signaling demonstrates how single-species QS molecules can coordinate multi-species community behavior in syntrophic
    bioleaching consortia.

- name: AHL Quorum Sensing Regulation
  description: 'N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing provides an additional layer of community coordination in the
    consortium. A. caldus and potentially S. thermosulfidooxidans possess AHL-type QS systems mediated by LuxI/LuxR homologs.
    Exogenous addition of long-chain AHLs (C12-AHL, C14-AHL, 3-OH-C12-AHL, 3-OH-C14-AHL at 5 μM each) repressed L. ferriphilum
    motility, contrasting with DSF effects that induced A. caldus motility. This demonstrates cross-species QS communication
    where A. caldus-produced AHL signals regulate L. ferriphilum behavior. AHL-mediated repression of L. ferriphilum motility
    may stabilize biofilm formation and mineral colonization during high cell density conditions. The opposing effects of
    DSF (inducing motility/dispersion in A. caldus while expanding L. ferriphilum biofilms) versus AHL (repressing L. ferriphilum
    motility) suggest complex multi-layered QS networks coordinate community assembly. These interacting QS systems may enable
    fine-tuned regulation of planktonic-biofilm transitions, niche partitioning, and metabolic specialization based on species
    composition and population densities. AHL-DSF cross-talk represents sophisticated intercellular communication in acidophilic
    biomining communities previously considered simple consortia.

    A. caldus optimum is pH 2.0-2.5, and S. thermosulfidooxidans tolerates similar acidity. Low pH is essential for maintaining
    ferric iron solubility (Fe³⁺ precipitates as Fe(OH)₃ at pH >3), enabling continued mineral oxidation. Acidic conditions
    protonate mineral surfaces, enhancing Fe³⁺ attack on sulfide bonds. The pH also selects against non-acidophilic contaminants,
    maintaining consortium purity. Media pH 2.0-2.5 represents the equilibrium between sulfuric acid production and buffering
    capacity, creating stable conditions for sustained iron and sulfur oxidation. This pH range is typical of industrial heap
    leach operations and acid mine drainage environments where these organisms naturally dominate.

    significant changes in community behavior: reduced pyrite and chalcopyrite dissolution, increased A. caldus motility and
    dispersion from minerals, expanded L. ferriphilum surface colonization, and decreased mineral-attached populations of
    all three species. These effects demonstrate that DSF acts as a density-dependent signal coordinating consortium-level
    transitions between biofilm and planktonic lifestyles. The 2 μM concentration likely represents biologically relevant
    levels achievable during high-density biofilm development. DSF signaling provides a mechanism for cells to sense population
    density and adjust metabolic strategies, mineral colonization patterns, and community spatial structure accordingly.

  description: 'The consortium was cultured with pyrite (FeS₂) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂) as mineral substrates and energy
    sources. Pyrite provides ferrous iron and sulfur for oxidation, while chalcopyrite releases copper, iron, and sulfur.
    These sulfide minerals create heterogeneous environments with mineral-attached (biofilm) and planktonic subpopulations
    that respond differentially to quorum sensing signals. Mineral surfaces provide attachment sites for biofilm formation,
    concentrated substrate access, and protection from environmental stresses. The consortium demonstrates mineral-specific
    dissolution patterns: DSF treatment reduced both pyrite and chalcopyrite dissolution, but effects on species distributions
    suggest mineral-dependent colonization preferences. Pyrite oxidation (FeS₂ + 14Fe³⁺ + 8H₂O → 15Fe²⁺ + 2SO₄²⁻ + 16H⁺) and
    chalcopyrite oxidation (CuFeS₂ + 4Fe³⁺ → Cu²⁺ + 5Fe²⁺ + 2S⁰) release substrates that sustain the iron and sulfur oxidation
    cycles. RNA extraction from planktonic cells after 14 days culture without supplemental iron indicates cells were dependent

    Constant agitation prevents oxygen limitation and maintains homogeneous planktonic populations while also facilitating

    zones that influence community structure. Aerobic conditions are typical of industrial heap leach operations where air
    exposure and irrigation maintain oxygen supply for sustained microbial activity. The requirement for oxygen distinguishes
