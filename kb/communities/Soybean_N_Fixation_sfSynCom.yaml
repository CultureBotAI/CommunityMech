name: Soybean N-Fixation Simplified SynCom
description: 'A simplified synthetic community (sfSynCom) for enhanced symbiotic nitrogen fixation in soybean, based on core-helper
  strain interactions. The consortium consists of Bradyrhizobium elkanii BXYD3 as the core nitrogen-fixing symbiont and two
  Pantoea helper strains. The helper strains produce acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) that enhance colonization and infection
  of soybean roots by B. elkanii through quorum sensing, significantly improving nodulation and nitrogen fixation compared
  to single-strain inoculation.

    snippet: This sfSynCom based on the core-helper strategy was more effective at promoting nodulation than inoculation with
      BXYD3 alone and achieved effects comparable to those of a complex elite SynCom previously constructed on the basis of
      potential beneficial functions between microbes and plants alone
