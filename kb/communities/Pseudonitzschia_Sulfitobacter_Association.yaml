name: Pseudo-nitzschia-Sulfitobacter Marine Association
description: 'A mutualistic marine diatom-bacteria association between Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries and Sulfitobacter sp.
  SA11, mediated by auxin and tryptophan signaling. The diatom produces tryptophan and taurine, which the bacterium uses to
  synthesize indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) auxin that promotes diatom growth. The bacterium also secretes ammonia as a nitrogen
  source. This interaction is widespread in ocean ecosystems and plays a significant role in carbon cycling and primary production.
