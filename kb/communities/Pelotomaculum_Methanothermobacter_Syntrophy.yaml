name: Pelotomaculum-Methanothermobacter Syntrophic Consortium
description: 'A thermophilic syntrophic, obligate two-member anaerobic consortium consisting of Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum,
  which oxidizes propionate and other organic acids (ethanol, lactate, alcohols) to acetate, CO2, and H2, and Methanothermobacter
  thermautotrophicus, a hydrogen-utilizing thermophilic methanogen. P. thermopropionicum oxidizes propionate only in coculture
  with H2-using methanogens, as it uses protons as the electron acceptor with H2 as the electron sink product. The removal
  of H2 by M. thermautotrophicus is thermodynamically essential for continued propionate oxidation by P. thermopropionicum.
  This thermophilic syntrophic relationship is fundamental to understanding propionate degradation and methane production
  at elevated temperatures (55°C) in anaerobic environments such as thermophilic digesters and hot springs.

- name: Propionate Oxidation and H2 Production
  description: 'Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum oxidizes propionate (C3) to acetate, CO2, and H2, using protons as the electron
    acceptor and producing H2 as the electron sink product. This propionate oxidation is thermodynamically unfavorable under
    standard conditions and only proceeds when H2 partial pressure is kept extremely low by a syntrophic partner. The organism
    cannot utilize common electron acceptors (nitrate, sulfate, etc.) and is therefore obligately dependent on syntrophic
    H2 removal. The coaggregation of P. thermopropionicum with M. thermautotrophicus facilitates efficient interspecies H2
    transfer at thermophilic temperatures (55°C).

  description: 'Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus consumes the H2 produced by P. thermopropionicum, combining it with
    CO2 to produce methane via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at thermophilic temperatures (55°C). This H2 removal maintains
    a low H2 partial pressure, making the thermodynamically unfavorable propionate oxidation by P. thermopropionicum energetically
    feasible. This interspecies hydrogen transfer (IHT) is enhanced by coaggregation between the two organisms, which reduces
    diffusion distances and improves syntrophic efficiency at elevated temperatures. This represents a classic example of
    thermophilic syntrophic metabolism in anaerobic environments.
