name: Geobacter-Clostridium DIET Community
description: 'A syntrophic two-member consortium consisting of Geobacter sulfurreducens and Clostridium pasteurianum that
  performs direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) during glycerol fermentation. G. sulfurreducens acts as an exoelectrogen,
  oxidizing acetate and transferring electrons directly to C. pasteurianum via electrically conductive pili (nanowires). These
  electron transfers induce a metabolic shift in C. pasteurianum''s glycerol fermentation pathway, redirecting carbon flux
  away from ethanol and butanol production toward increased 1,3-propanediol (PDO) and butyrate production. This represents
  a unique application of DIET where electron transfer serves not to drive methanogenesis but to modulate fermentation pathways,
  achieving a 37% increase in 1,3-propanediol and 38% increase in butyrate production. The bacteria establish physical contact
  through nanowires, enabling electron exchange without relying on diffusible hydrogen or formate carriers. This coculture
  demonstrates how controlled interspecies electron transfer can be exploited to optimize production of industrially relevant
  metabolites like 1,3-propanediol.

      oxidizes acetate and transfers electrons to C. pasteurianum via electrically conductive pili (nanowires). These pili

      pasteurianum as the sole electron acceptor, and the extent of G. sulfurreducens growth (measured by qPCR of 16S rRNA
      genes) directly correlates with the magnitude of metabolic shifts in C. pasteurianum, explaining 76-90% of the total
      variance in metabolite yields. Despite consuming less than 0.6% of the electrons used by C. pasteurianum, the electron
      transfer from G. sulfurreducens has profound effects on fermentation product distribution.

- name: Glycerol Fermentation with DIET-Induced Metabolic Shift
  description: 'Clostridium pasteurianum ferments glycerol, and upon receiving electrons from G. sulfurreducens via DIET,
    undergoes a dramatic metabolic shift that redirects carbon flux toward increased 1,3-propanediol (PDO) and butyrate production.
    In pure culture, C. pasteurianum produces primarily butanol (225 mmol/mol glycerol) and ethanol (54 mmol/mol). However,
    when DIET is enabled, production shifts to favor 1,3-propanediol (241 mmol/mol, +37%) and butyrate (105 mmol/mol, +38%),
    while butanol and ethanol decrease by 16% and 20% respectively. This metabolic reprogramming is induced by minimal electron
    uptake (<0.6% of total electrons consumed by C. pasteurianum), demonstrating the regulatory role of electron transfer
    in controlling fermentation pathways. The shift represents a biotechnologically valuable outcome, as 1,3-propanediol is
    an industrially important chemical used in polymer production.
