name: Rifle Uranium-Reducing Community
description: 'A microbial community stimulated for in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater at the Old Rifle
  site in Rifle, Colorado. This aquifer community demonstrates sequential reduction processes following acetate biostimulation
  at 1-3 mM concentrations. The community transitions through distinct metabolic phases: Phase I (days 0-50) dominated by
  Geobacter species (up to 89% of community) performing Fe(III) reduction coupled to U(VI) reduction, achieving 70% uranium
  removal within 50 days and reducing concentrations below the EPA treatment goal of 0.18 μM in some wells. Phase II (>50
  days) shifts to sulfate-reducing bacteria including Desulfobacteraceae (45% by day 80), Desulfosporosinus, and Desulfotomaculum
  acetoxidans as Fe(III) becomes depleted. Geobacter metallireducens and Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans reduce soluble U(VI)
  to insoluble U(IV), forming biogenic uraninite nanoparticles that immobilize uranium. Desulfovibrio species contribute to
  uranium reduction through enzymatic pathways while generating hydrogen sulfide that can chemically reduce uranium. This
  represents the first successful field demonstration of uranium bioremediation via stimulating subsurface Geobacter populations,
  providing an alternative to pump-and-treat remediation. Groundwater flow rate is 0.82 m/day, creating dynamic conditions
  where microbial metabolism must outpace uranium advection.
