name: Sorghum SRC1 Subset Community
description: 'A simplified synthetic rhizosphere community (SRC1-subset) derived from the larger SRC1 consortium for enhancing
  sorghum bioenergy crop productivity. The subset consists of 16-20 bacterial strains selected from the full 57-strain SRC1
  community, including multiple Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Arthrobacter strains. This engineered community was designed using
  network analysis to identify hub taxa and strains capable of utilizing sorghum-specific root exudate compounds. Field-tested
  studies demonstrate that the community effectively colonizes sorghum rhizosphere and roots, leading to increased shoot biomass
  and improved yield performance under field conditions. The growth enhancement correlates with transcriptional dampening
  of lignin biosynthesis in the host plant.
