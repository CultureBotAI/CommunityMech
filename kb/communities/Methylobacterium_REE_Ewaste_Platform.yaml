name: Methylobacterium REE E-waste Platform
description: 'An engineered monoculture bioplatform based on the mesophilic methylotrophic bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens
  AM1 for sustainable recovery of rare earth elements (REE) from electronic waste. This system represents a paradigm shift
  in critical materials recovery through non-acidic, green bioprocessing that eliminates the harsh chemical leaching typical
  of conventional REE extraction. M. extorquens naturally accumulates REE in intracellular polyphosphate granules during methanol
  metabolism, achieving baseline bioaccumulation of 3.2 mg Nd/g dry cell weight. Through metabolic engineering—overexpression
  of lanthanophore biosynthesis genes (mll operon under lac promoter control) and deletion of exopolyphosphatase (ppx)—REE
  bioaccumulation was enhanced to 202 mg Nd/g DCW (63-fold improvement), representing one of the highest microbial REE loading
  capacities reported. The platform achieves remarkable selectivity with 98% of accumulated metal being REE and 96.8% of that
  being neodymium, critical for permanent magnet recycling. The system operates at near-neutral pH (6.9), mesophilic temperature
  (29-30°C), and scales to 10-liter bioreactors with controlled organic acid supplementation (5-15 mM citrate). After bioleaching
  with citrate, 58.7 ppm REE are mobilized from electronic waste (magnet swarf), followed by cellular bioaccumulation and
  recovery. This consolidated platform integrates leaching, bioaccumulation, and recovery in a single organism, offering environmental
  advantages over acidic chemical processing while addressing circular economy needs for critical materials in clean energy
  technologies.

    notes: 'Mesophilic methylotrophic alphaproteobacterium engineered for enhanced REE bioaccumulation from electronic waste.
      The AM1 strain naturally grows on methanol and C1 compounds, utilizing the serine cycle for carbon assimilation. M.
      extorquens exhibits intrinsic REE bioaccumulation capability through lanthanophore biosynthesis (mll genes encoding
      siderophore-like REE chelators) and storage in intracellular polyphosphate granules. Genetic engineering enhanced this
      native capability: (1) mll operon overexpression under lac promoter increased lanthanophore production for REE scavenging,
      and (2) ppx deletion (exopolyphosphatase knockout) prevented polyphosphate degradation, stabilizing REE-polyphosphate
      complexes and achieving 202 mg Nd/g DCW (63-fold over wild-type). The engineered strain demonstrates exceptional REE
      selectivity (98% of metals) and Nd specificity (96.8%), making it ideal for permanent magnet recycling. The platform
      integrates bioleaching (citrate/gluconate-mediated REE mobilization from e-waste) and bioaccumulation (cellular REE
      uptake) in a single organism, representing a consolidated bioprocessing approach. The system scales to 10 L bioreactors,
      operates at neutral pH (6.9), and produces REE-loaded biomass amenable to downstream recovery through ashing or acid
      digestion.

  description: 'Methylobacterium extorquens mobilizes rare earth elements from electronic waste substrates (magnet swarf,
    phosphors) through supplementation with organic acids including citrate (5-15 mM trisodium citrate dihydrate), gluconate
    (55 mM sodium gluconate), and oxalic acid (5 mM). Citrate is the most effective chelator, with 15 mM citrate leaching
    58.7 ± 0.6 ppm REE from e-waste after 28 hours, compared to 8.2 ± 0.1 ppm at 5 mM citrate. The organic acids complex REE
    cations bound in Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets and phosphor matrices, solubilizing them into aqueous phase where they become
    bioavailable for cellular uptake. This non-acidic leaching (pH 6.9) contrasts sharply with conventional acid digestion
    (concentrated HCl, H₂SO₄) used in industrial REE recovery, offering significant environmental benefits through reduced
    corrosivity, energy consumption, and hazardous waste generation. The citrate-mediated bioleaching represents the first
    step in the consolidated bioprocessing platform, generating a REE-rich leachate that feeds the bioaccumulation stage.

  description: 'REE transported into M. extorquens cells are sequestered in intracellular polyphosphate granules, forming
    stable REE-phosphate complexes that immobilize the metals and protect cellular machinery from REE toxicity. Polyphosphate
    granules are polyanionic polymers (chains of phosphate residues linked by high-energy bonds) that serve as phosphate and
    energy reserves in bacteria. The phosphate groups coordinate REE cations through electrostatic and covalent bonding, creating
    insoluble precipitates within the granules. Genetic deletion of exopolyphosphatase (ppx) prevents degradation of these
    polyphosphate-REE complexes, stabilizing REE accumulation and achieving the highest reported bioaccumulation: 202 mg Nd/g
    DCW (63-fold improvement over wild-type). The ppx knockout eliminates the enzyme that cleaves polyphosphate chains, preventing
    REE release back into cytoplasm and enabling sustained accumulation over multiple growth cycles. This genetic strategy
    transformed a transient biosorption process into stable long-term bioaccumulation, making M. extorquens a practical platform
    for industrial-scale REE recovery. The polyphosphate granules can be visualized by TEM and provide a concentrated REE
    reservoir amenable to downstream recovery through biomass ashing or acid digestion.

- name: Methanol-Powered REE Acquisition Metabolism
  description: 'M. extorquens couples REE bioaccumulation to its native methylotrophic metabolism, using methanol as carbon
    and energy source while simultaneously acquiring REE to support growth. The bacterium naturally requires REE as cofactors
    for methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), the key enzyme catalyzing methanol oxidation (CH₃OH → formaldehyde). MDH contains a
    pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor and a REE cation (La³⁺ or other light REE) at its active site, where the REE serves
    as a Lewis acid to activate the alcohol substrate. This metabolic dependency on REE makes M. extorquens naturally competent
    at scavenging trace REE from environments and explains its evolution of lanthanophore biosynthesis systems. By growing
    on electronic waste supplemented with methanol, the organism directly couples critical materials recovery (REE bioaccumulation)
    to energy metabolism, creating a self-sustaining bioprocessing cycle. The system operates in HyphoMOD minimal medium with
    reduced phosphate (to prevent phosphate-mediated REE precipitation outside cells), achieving sustained growth and REE
    accumulation. This metabolic integration distinguishes the platform from passive biosorption systems, enabling active,
    energy-dependent REE uptake and concentration against gradients.
