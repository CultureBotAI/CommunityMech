name: Mixed Gallium LED Recovery Consortium
description: 'An engineered acidophilic microbial consortium specifically designed for recovering gallium from waste light-emitting
  diodes (LEDs) through non-contact bioleaching. This mixed community consists of three iron- and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria
  in equal proportions (1:1:1 ratio): Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans.
  The consortium produces biogenic lixiviants - primarily sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) from sulfur oxidation and ferric iron (Fe³⁺)
  from iron oxidation - that solubilize gallium from GaN-based LED materials without direct contact between microbes and solid
  waste. Operating at pH 1.0-1.5 and 15 g/L pulp density, the system achieves exceptional 99.5% gallium leaching efficiency
  within just 3 days. The non-contact bioleaching approach separates the bioreactor (where microbes generate lixiviants) from
  the leaching reactor (where acids attack LED waste), preventing microbial inhibition by toxic LED components while enabling
  gallium recovery. In addition to gallium, the process recovers copper and nickel from LED substrates and interconnects.
  This biotechnological platform offers a sustainable alternative to harsh chemical leaching methods, utilizing microbial
  metabolism to extract critical materials from electronic waste while avoiding toxic emissions and reducing environmental
  impact.

  notes: 'Engineered two-stage bioleaching system for gallium recovery from waste LEDs. The non-contact process consists of:
    (1) a bioreactor where the acidophilic consortium generates sulfuric acid and ferric iron lixiviants at pH 1.0-1.5, and
    (2) a leaching reactor where spent lixiviant (pH 1.5) attacks crushed LED waste at 15 g/L pulp density. Waste LEDs contain
    gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor layers, copper interconnects, nickel plating, and polymer encapsulants on substrates
    (often sapphire or silicon). The separation between microbial and leaching stages prevents toxic LED materials from inhibiting
    bacterial growth while enabling efficient metal recovery. Operating temperature is mesophilic (~30°C), and the process
    achieves 99.5% gallium extraction in 3 days compared to longer durations or lower efficiencies with conventional chemical
    methods.

- name: Biogenic Sulfuric Acid Production for Gallium Leaching
  description: 'Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans oxidizes elemental sulfur and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds to generate
    sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), the primary biogenic lixiviant for gallium dissolution from waste LEDs. The sulfur oxidation process
    (S⁰ + 1.5O₂ + H₂O → H₂SO₄) produces protons that maintain extremely low pH (1.0-1.5) in the bioreactor. This acidic lixiviant
    is then transferred to the leaching reactor where it attacks gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor layers in crushed LED
    waste. The sulfuric acid protonates GaN surfaces and solubilizes gallium according to: GaN + 3H₂SO₄ → Ga³⁺ + NH₄⁺ + 3SO₄²⁻.
    The non-contact bioleaching design separates microbial acid production from LED leaching, preventing toxic LED components
    (polymers, epoxies, heavy metals) from inhibiting At. thiooxidans while enabling continuous lixiviant generation. This
    process achieves remarkable 99.5% gallium recovery in just 3 days at 15 g/L pulp density, far exceeding conventional chemical
    leaching methods. The biogenic acid also mobilizes copper and nickel from LED interconnects and plating.

    GaN semiconductor materials. The mixed consortium design with both At. ferrooxidans and L. ferrooxidans ensures robust
    iron oxidation across the pH 1.0-1.5 range - At. ferrooxidans provides activity at pH >1.5 while L. ferrooxidans excels
    at pH <1.5. This complementary pH tolerance maintains continuous Fe³⁺ supply. The non-contact design allows iron oxidizers

    sulfur and iron substrates, generating sulfuric acid and ferric iron without exposure to toxic LED components (polymers,

    is separated from solid residues, while depleted lixiviant can be recycled to the bioreactor for regeneration. This two-stage
