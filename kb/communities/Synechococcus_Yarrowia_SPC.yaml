name: Synechococcus-Yarrowia Synthetic Photosynthetic Consortium
description: 'A synthetic, light-driven consortium pairing the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (engineered
  to secrete sucrose via the cscB+ transporter) with the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica Po1g. The cyanobacterium fixes
  CO2 and exports sucrose, which Y. lipolytica converts to lipids for biofuel production. This system demonstrates photosynthetic
  carbon capture coupled to lipid biosynthesis in a modular platform.

  objective: A synthetic, light-driven consortium pairing the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (engineered to secrete sucrose via the cscB+ transporter) with the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica Po1g.
  assembly_strategy: Engineered 2-member consortium configured for other objectives.
  measurement_endpoints:
  - Interaction-level mechanistic characterization
  - Member-level abundance and persistence tracking
  notes: Backfilled engineering-design metadata from existing curation; refine with protocol-level parameters when available.
