name: Geobacter-Methanosaeta DIET Community
description: 'A syntrophic two-member consortium consisting of Geobacter metallireducens and Methanosaeta harundinacea that
  performs direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) during ethanol oxidation. G. metallireducens oxidizes ethanol and
  transfers electrons directly to M. harundinacea via electrically conductive pili and aggregates, bypassing the need for
  diffusible electron carriers like H2 or formate. M. harundinacea uses these electrons to reduce CO2 to methane. This coculture
  forms conductive aggregates and achieves stoichiometric conversion of ethanol to methane via DIET. Unlike hydrogen-mediated
  syntrophy, DIET relies on biological electrical connections between cells, with conductive aggregates serving as conduits
  for long-range electron transfer. M. harundinacea is an obligate acetoclastic methanogen that can also accept electrons
  via DIET for CO2 reduction, making it unique among acetoclastic methanogens in supporting direct electron transfer mechanisms.

    transfer mechanisms beyond the more metabolically versatile Methanosarcina species. The electron transfer enables stoichiometric
