name: Chlamydomonas-Methylobacterium Mutualistic Consortium
description: 'A two-member mutualistic consortium consisting of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the methylotrophic
  bacterium Methylobacterium aquaticum, isolated from a freshwater environment. This natural association demonstrates reciprocal
  metabolic exchange under nitrogen stress conditions, mediated by indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) signaling. The alga provides
  photosynthetically fixed carbon and oxygen, while Methylobacterium modulates IAA levels through both production and degradation,
  influencing algal physiology and stress responses. This system serves as a model for understanding algae-bacteria interactions
  in freshwater ecosystems and potential applications in sustainable algal biotechnology under nutrient limitation.

  description: 'Methylobacterium aquaticum both produces and degrades indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a critical phytohormone
    that influences algal physiology, growth, and stress responses. IAA production by bacteria can stimulate algal growth
    at low concentrations but may also modulate stress signaling pathways. The balance between IAA biosynthesis and degradation
    by Methylobacterium creates a dynamic signaling environment that affects the algal partner, particularly under nitrogen
    stress conditions. This bidirectional IAA metabolism represents a key mechanism of bacteria-algae communication.

  description: 'The mutualistic interaction between C. reinhardtii and M. aquaticum is particularly relevant under nitrogen
    stress conditions. IAA signaling from Methylobacterium influences how the alga responds to nitrogen limitation, potentially
    affecting stress tolerance, metabolic adjustments, and survival. The bacterial partner may also benefit from nitrogen-containing
    compounds released by the stressed alga, or may help alleviate stress through growth promotion or metabolic support. This
    interaction demonstrates how bacteria can modulate eukaryotic microalgal stress physiology through small molecule signaling.
