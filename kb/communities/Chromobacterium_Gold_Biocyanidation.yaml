name: Chromobacterium Gold Biocyanidation Platform
description: >
  An engineered bioplatform utilizing the purple pigmented bacterium Chromobacterium
  violaceum for sustainable gold extraction from refractory ores and electronic waste
  through biological cyanide production (biocyanidation). This system represents an
  environmentally-friendly alternative to conventional chemical cyanide leaching,
  producing controlled amounts of biogenic cyanide that complexes gold as soluble
  Au(CN)₂⁻ while simultaneously metabolizing excess cyanide to prevent environmental
  toxicity. C. violaceum is a versatile heterotrophic bacterium that produces the
  purple pigment violacein and synthesizes cyanide through hydrogen cyanide (HCN)
  biosynthesis pathways. The bacterium is pre-grown in nutrient medium to stationary
  phase, then activated for cyanide production upon exposure to ground refractory
  gold ores or electronic scrap (PCBs, connectors). Operating at near-neutral pH
  (6.5-7.5) and mesophilic temperature (28-32°C), the system achieves gold extraction
  efficiencies comparable to chemical cyanidation (70-85% recovery) from refractory
  sulfide ores and precious metal-bearing e-waste. The process requires ore grinding
  pretreatment to liberate gold particles and operates in aerated bioreactors with
  glycerol or glucose as carbon source. Biocyanidation kinetics are slower than
  chemical leaching (7-14 days vs. 24-48 hours) but offer significant advantages:
  lower cyanide concentrations (50-200 ppm vs. 500-2000 ppm), ambient temperature
  operation, biological cyanide detoxification, and reduced environmental liability.
  The platform enables decentralized gold recovery from low-grade ores and artisanal
  mining operations while avoiding hazardous chemical transport. Gold is recovered
  from pregnant leach solution by activated carbon adsorption followed by elution
  and electrowinning or zinc cementation.

    Bioreactor environment for gold biocyanidation from refractory ores and electronic
    waste. Substrates include arsenopyrite-gold ores, pyrite-gold concentrates,
    double-refractory carbonaceous sulfide ores, and electronic scrap (PCBs, gold
    connectors, plated components). Refractory ores require grinding pretreatment
    (200-400 mesh) to expose gold particles occluded in sulfide minerals. Operating
    conditions: pH 6.5-7.5 (neutral vs. alkaline chemical cyanidation at pH 10-11),
    temperature 28-32°C (mesophilic), 7-14 day leaching cycles. The bioreactor is
    aerated to supply oxygen for aerobic metabolism and supplemented with glycerol,
    glucose, or other carbon sources to support bacterial growth and cyanide
    biosynthesis. Ore pulp density ranges from 5-15% w/v. The engineered system
    produces biogenic HCN that volatilizes and dissolves to form CN⁻ in solution,
    which complexes gold as dicyanoaurate [Au(CN)₂]⁻. Chromobacterium simultaneously
    detoxifies excess cyanide through cyanide hydratase/formamidase pathways,
    preventing environmental accumulation.

        label: Chromobacterium violaceum
      notes: >
        Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, mesophilic betaproteobacterium
        isolated from tropical and subtropical soils and waters. Chromobacterium
        violaceum is distinguished by production of the purple pigment violacein, a
        bis-indole compound with antimicrobial and anticancer properties. The bacterium
        naturally produces hydrogen cyanide (HCN) through amino acid metabolism as a
        defensive compound and signaling molecule. HCN biosynthesis is encoded by the
        hcnABC gene cluster, which catalyzes conversion of glycine to HCN via glycine
        dehydrogenase. In biocyanidation applications, C. violaceum is pre-grown to
        stationary phase (10⁸-10⁹ CFU/ml) in nutrient broth with glycerol or glucose,
        then activated by exposure to ground gold ore or e-waste. The bacterium
        produces controlled amounts of cyanide (50-200 ppm in solution) sufficient
        for gold complexation while avoiding toxicity. C. violaceum possesses cyanide
        detoxification capability through cyanide hydratase (converts HCN to formamide)
        and formamidase (converts formamide to formate + ammonia), enabling it to
        metabolize excess cyanide and prevent environmental accumulation. This
        dual-function capability - cyanide production plus detoxification - makes
        C. violaceum uniquely suited for sustainable gold extraction. Gold recovery
        from refractory arsenopyrite ores reaches 70-85% after 7-14 days, comparable
        to chemical cyanidation but at neutral pH and mesophilic temperature. The
        system processes both primary ores and secondary e-waste (PCBs, connectors,
        electroplated scrap) where gold is present in metallic form or thin coatings.
        Violacein production serves as a visual indicator of culture viability and
        metabolic activity.

# Ecological interactions - biogenic cyanide production and gold complexation
ecological_interactions:
  - name: Biogenic Cyanide Production from Glycine
    description: >
      Chromobacterium violaceum synthesizes hydrogen cyanide (HCN) through the
      hcnABC gene cluster, which encodes a hydrogen cyanide synthase complex that
      converts glycine to HCN, CO₂, and ammonia. The reaction proceeds: glycine +
      NADH + H⁺ → HCN + CO₂ + NH₃ + NAD⁺. HCN biosynthesis is activated when the
      pre-grown bacterial culture encounters ground gold ore or e-waste substrates,
      potentially triggered by metal stress or nutrient limitation. Glycerol or
      glucose provided as carbon source is metabolized to produce glycine precursors
      for cyanogenesis. The volatile HCN (bp 25.6°C) partitions into headspace and
      dissolves in aqueous solution, dissociating to H⁺ + CN⁻ at pH 6.5-7.5 (pKa
      HCN = 9.3, so <1% dissociation at neutral pH, but equilibrium shifts as CN⁻
      is consumed by gold complexation). Biocyanidation systems maintain steady-state
      cyanide concentrations of 50-200 ppm, significantly lower than chemical
      cyanidation (500-2000 ppm), reducing environmental hazard while providing
      sufficient CN⁻ for gold leaching. Cyanide production continues for 7-14 days
      as long as carbon source and ore substrate remain available. The purple
      violacein pigment serves as visual indicator of bacterial viability and
      metabolic activity throughout the process.

  - name: Gold Cyanide Complexation and Dissolution
    description: >
      Biogenic cyanide produced by C. violaceum reacts with metallic gold in
      refractory ores and electronic waste to form the soluble dicyanoaurate complex
      [Au(CN)₂]⁻. The overall reaction (Elsner equation) requires oxygen: 4Au⁰ +
      8CN⁻ + O₂ + 2H₂O → 4Au(CN)₂⁻ + 4OH⁻. This process liberates gold from
      refractory arsenopyrite (FeAsS) and pyrite (FeS₂) matrices where submicron
      gold particles are occluded in sulfide mineral lattices, inaccessible to
      gravity or flotation methods. Ore grinding pretreatment (200-400 mesh) is
      required to expose gold surfaces and create reactive contact area. Biocyanidation
      achieves 70-85% gold extraction from refractory sulfide ores over 7-14 days,
      comparable to chemical cyanidation but at neutral pH (6.5-7.5 vs. pH 10-11)
      and ambient temperature (28-32°C vs. elevated temperatures). For electronic
      waste, biogenic cyanide dissolves gold from PCB connectors, gold fingers, wire
      bonding, and electroplated components. The lower cyanide concentrations
      (50-200 ppm) in biocyanidation reduce environmental liability and detoxification
      costs compared to chemical processes. Dissolved gold in pregnant leach solution
      (PLS) is recovered by activated carbon adsorption (gold loads onto carbon as
      neutral Au(CN)₂ complex), followed by carbon elution with hot caustic cyanide
      solution and gold recovery by electrowinning or zinc cementation (Zn⁰ + 2Au(CN)₂⁻
      → 2Au⁰ + Zn(CN)₄²⁻). The biocyanidation platform enables processing of
      double-refractory ores (carbonaceous sulfides) and low-grade materials
      uneconomical for conventional methods.

  - name: Biological Cyanide Detoxification
    description: >
      Chromobacterium violaceum possesses enzymatic pathways for metabolizing excess
      cyanide, preventing environmental accumulation and reducing detoxification
      costs compared to chemical cyanidation. The primary pathway involves cyanide
      hydratase (CynD), which catalyzes hydration of HCN to formamide: HCN + H₂O →
      HCONH₂. Formamidase (CynE) then hydrolyzes formamide to formate and ammonia:
      HCONH₂ + H₂O → HCOO⁻ + NH₄⁺. Formate is subsequently oxidized to CO₂ via
      formate dehydrogenase, completing cyanide mineralization to benign end products.
      This detoxification capability enables C. violaceum to produce controlled,
      transient cyanide pulses rather than accumulating toxic levels. As gold
      complexation consumes CN⁻ to form Au(CN)₂⁻, residual unreacted cyanide is
      metabolized by the bacterial culture, maintaining safe levels (50-200 ppm)
      throughout the 7-14 day leaching cycle. After gold recovery by carbon adsorption,
      the residual leach solution (barren solution) contains minimal cyanide that
      can be further biodegraded by extended bacterial incubation before discharge
      or recycling. This biological detoxification contrasts sharply with chemical
      cyanidation, which requires expensive alkaline chlorination (Cl₂ oxidizes CN⁻
      to CNO⁻ and N₂) or SO₂/air oxidation for cyanide destruction. The integrated
      production-detoxification capability of C. violaceum reduces operational costs,
      environmental liability, and regulatory compliance burdens, making biocyanidation
      attractive for artisanal mining and decentralized e-waste processing where
      chemical cyanide transport and handling are problematic.

  - name: Ore Pretreatment and Particle Size Effects
    description: >
      Refractory gold ores require grinding pretreatment to expose gold particles
      occluded in arsenopyrite, pyrite, and other sulfide mineral matrices. Chromobacterium
      violaceum-mediated biocyanidation efficiency increases with decreasing particle
      size as grinding creates greater reactive surface area for cyanide contact
      with gold. Optimal grinding to 200-400 mesh (37-74 μm) liberates submicron
      gold inclusions while maintaining economical grinding energy consumption.
      Without grinding, gold particles remain locked in sulfide lattices inaccessible
      to cyanide complexation. For electronic waste (PCBs, connectors), mechanical
      shredding and size reduction improve gold exposure and biocyanidation kinetics.
      The ore pulp is maintained at 5-15% w/v solids density in aerated bioreactors
      with agitation to ensure uniform contact between biogenic cyanide and gold-bearing
      particles. Double-refractory ores (carbonaceous sulfides) contain organic
      carbon (preg-robbing) that adsorbs dissolved Au(CN)₂⁻, reducing recovery;
      these ores may require pre-oxidation (roasting or pressure oxidation) before
      biocyanidation. The mesophilic operation (28-32°C) and near-neutral pH (6.5-7.5)
      of biocyanidation enable processing of ores and e-waste at ambient conditions
      without heating or pH adjustment, reducing energy costs compared to chemical
      cyanidation (often pH 10-11, sometimes elevated temperature).

      addition for pH control, reduces reagent costs, and minimizes metal hydroxide
      precipitation that can interfere with gold leaching. At pH 6.5-7.5, HCN (pKa
      9.3) exists predominantly in protonated form, enabling volatilization and
      gas-liquid equilibrium. However, as gold complexation consumes CN⁻, the

    unit: "% recovery"
    description: >
      Biocyanidation achieves 70-85% gold recovery from refractory arsenopyrite
      and pyrite ores, comparable to chemical cyanidation but with environmental
      advantages. Recovery depends on ore mineralogy, particle size (grinding
      liberation), cyanide concentration, oxygen availability, and leaching time.
      Double-refractory carbonaceous ores may show lower recovery due to preg-robbing
      (organic carbon adsorption of Au(CN)₂⁻). For electronic waste, gold recovery
      from connectors and plated components approaches 80-90% as metallic gold is
      readily accessible to cyanide complexation. The recovery efficiency makes
      biocyanidation economically viable for ores with >1 g/t Au content and e-waste
      streams with >100 ppm Au concentration.

  - name: Ore Pulp Density
    value: "5-15"
    unit: "% w/v"
    description: >
      Ore pulp density (solids concentration) ranges from 5-15% w/v (50-150 g/L)
      in biocyanidation systems, balancing gold recovery per batch against bacterial
      viability and oxygen transfer. Higher pulp densities increase gold loading
      but may inhibit bacterial metabolism through substrate toxicity (arsenic,
      sulfides, heavy metals from ore dissolution) and reduced oxygen availability
      in dense slurries. Lower densities favor bacterial activity but reduce
      throughput. Optimal pulp density depends on ore composition, with refractory
      sulfides requiring lower densities (5-10%) to minimize toxicity, while e-waste
      can tolerate higher densities (10-15%). Aeration and agitation maintain oxygen
      saturation and particle suspension throughout the leaching cycle.

  - name: Particle Size (Ore Grinding)
    value: "200-400"
    unit: "mesh (37-74 μm)"
    description: >
      Grinding refractory ores to 200-400 mesh (37-74 μm) is required to liberate
      submicron gold particles occluded in arsenopyrite and pyrite matrices.
      Particle size directly affects biocyanidation efficiency, with finer grinding
      increasing reactive surface area for cyanide-gold contact but also increasing
      grinding energy costs. The 200-400 mesh range represents an economic optimum
      balancing liberation, leaching kinetics, and energy consumption. Without
      adequate grinding, gold remains locked in sulfide lattices inaccessible to
      cyanide, reducing recovery to <30%. For e-waste, mechanical shredding to
      <5 mm particle size adequately exposes gold surfaces on connectors, fingers,
      and plated components.

  - name: Carbon Source for Bacterial Growth
    value: "Glycerol or glucose"
    unit: "qualitative"
    description: >
      Chromobacterium violaceum requires organic carbon source (glycerol or glucose)
      to support heterotrophic growth and provide metabolic precursors for cyanide
      biosynthesis. Glycerol (waste product from biodiesel production) is preferred
      for cost-effectiveness and serves as carbon/energy source while being metabolized
      to glycine for HCN synthesis. Glucose is an effective alternative carbon
      source. Carbon supplementation distinguishes biocyanidation from autotrophic
      bioprocesses and represents an operational cost that must be optimized.
      Typical carbon dosing: 0.5-2% v/v glycerol or 5-10 g/L glucose. Excess carbon
      supports bacterial growth to high densities (10⁸-10⁹ CFU/ml) needed for
      sustained cyanogenesis.

  - name: Oxygen Requirement
    value: "Aerobic with aeration"
    unit: "qualitative"
    description: >
      Biocyanidation requires oxygen for two critical functions: (1) aerobic bacterial
      respiration supporting C. violaceum growth and metabolism, and (2) gold
      oxidation in the Elsner equation (4Au⁰ + 8CN⁻ + O₂ + 2H₂O → 4Au(CN)₂⁻ +
      4OH⁻). Bioreactors are actively aerated (air sparging or mechanical agitation)
      to maintain dissolved oxygen >2 mg/L throughout the ore pulp. Oxygen limitation
      reduces both bacterial viability and gold complexation kinetics. The aerobic
      requirement contrasts with anaerobic bioprocesses and necessitates energy
      input for aeration, but enables rapid gold dissolution once sufficient cyanide
      is produced.

  - name: Pre-growth and Activation Protocol
    value: "Stationary phase pre-growth"
    unit: "qualitative"
    description: >
      Chromobacterium violaceum is pre-grown to stationary phase (10⁸-10⁹ CFU/ml,
      24-48 hours) in nutrient broth with glycerol before being activated by exposure
      to ground refractory ore or e-waste. This two-stage approach maximizes biomass
      production under optimal growth conditions, then triggers cyanogenesis upon
      substrate addition. Pre-growth separates bacterial propagation (which may
      be inhibited by ore toxicity) from biocyanidation (where high cell density
      is required for sufficient HCN production). The pre-grown culture is transferred
      to ore slurry (5-15% pulp density) supplemented with carbon source, initiating
      the 7-14 day leaching cycle. Violacein pigment development during pre-growth
      serves as visual quality control indicator.

  - name: Substrate Ore Types
    value: "Refractory arsenopyrite, pyrite, carbonaceous sulfides"
    unit: "qualitative"
    description: >
      Biocyanidation targets refractory gold ores where submicron gold particles
      are occluded in sulfide minerals (arsenopyrite FeAsS, pyrite FeS₂) or
      carbonaceous matrices, making them inaccessible to gravity/flotation concentration.
      These ores require cyanide leaching for economic gold extraction. Arsenopyrite-gold
      ores are particularly suitable as grinding liberates gold for cyanide attack.
      Double-refractory carbonaceous sulfides contain organic carbon that adsorbs
      Au(CN)₂⁻ (preg-robbing), reducing recovery unless pre-oxidized. The biocyanidation
      platform also processes electronic waste including PCBs (gold fingers, connectors),
      integrated circuit bonding wires, electroplated components, and jewelry scrap.
      E-waste typically contains 50-500 ppm gold in readily accessible metallic
      form, enabling high recovery (80-90%) with shorter leaching times (3-7 days).
