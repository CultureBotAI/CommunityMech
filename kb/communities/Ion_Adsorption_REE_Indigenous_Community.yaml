name: Ion-Adsorption REE Indigenous Community
description: 'A highly diverse indigenous microbial community in ion-adsorption rare earth element (REE) deposits in weathering
  profiles of South China, demonstrating remarkable selectivity for heavy rare earth elements (HREE) through bacterial teichoic
  acid binding. This natural community comprises over 700 genera spanning bacterial (84.2% dominated by Proteobacteria 46.9%,
  Acidobacteria 14.6%, Actinobacteria 9.0%, Firmicutes 6.3%) and fungal (Ascomycota 47.8%, Basidiomycota 40.4%) lineages distributed
  through weathering profiles up to 40 meters depth. The community exhibits unique HREE vs LREE fractionation capability,
  with Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus, Micrococcus) preferentially adsorbing HREE (82-85% efficiency) compared to LREE (70-78%),
  driven by teichoic acids in cell walls that provide selective phosphate binding sites for heavier lanthanides. Removal of
  teichoic acids reduces REE adsorption from 65.5% to 17.8%, confirming their critical role. The community accelerates REE
  mineralization in supergene weathering environments through bioweathering of granite, dissolution of REE-bearing minerals,
  and biosorption-mediated HREE enrichment. Ion-adsorption deposits represent the world''s main source of strategically critical
  HREE (Dy, Y, Tb, Eu) used in permanent magnets and phosphors, with over 40 deposit sites in South China. The indigenous
  microbial community functions across pH gradients (4.3-7.0), exhibits oligotrophic K-strategist adaptations (Acidobacteria),
  and demonstrates co-localization of ytterbium with phosphate-rich cell walls. This natural HREE fractionation system offers
  a sustainable model for selective REE recovery and explains the geological genesis of commercially valuable HREE-enriched
  clay deposits.

  description: 'Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus, Micrococcus) selectively adsorb heavy rare earth elements (HREE) through
    teichoic acids in their cell walls, achieving 82-85% HREE uptake versus 70-78% LREE uptake. Teichoic acids are anionic
    polymers containing phosphate groups that serve as the primary binding sites for REE cations. The selectivity arises from
    lanthanide contraction—the progressive decrease in ionic radius from La³⁺ (1.16 Å) to Lu³⁺ (0.98 Å) across the lanthanide
    series. Smaller HREE cations form stronger coordination bonds with phosphate oxygen atoms due to higher charge density
    and better geometric fit. TEM/EDS spectroscopy confirmed co-localization of ytterbium (Yb, Z=70) with phosphorus along
    bacterial cell walls, demonstrating P-O-REE bonding. Removal of teichoic acids reduced REE adsorption from 65.5% to 17.8%,

  description: 'Proteobacteria (Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas), Actinobacteria, and fungi (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota) accelerate
    weathering of granitic bedrock and dissolution of REE-bearing minerals through production of organic acids (citric, oxalic,
    gluconic), siderophores, and extracellular enzymes. Bacterial and fungal metabolites acidify the microenvironment, protonate
    silicate minerals, and complex REE cations, driving mineral dissolution rates orders of magnitude faster than abiotic

    phases like monazite, xenotime, and REE-enriched clays. Fungal hyphae physically penetrate grain boundaries and chemically
    attack mineral surfaces, creating high surface-area weathering zones. This bioweathering process transforms primary REE
    minerals into secondary clay-bound ion-adsorption forms that are economically extractable through simple ammonium sulfate
    leaching. The biogeochemical cascade (mineral dissolution → REE release → biosorption → HREE fractionation) drives formation

  unit: '% global HREE supply'
  description: 'South China ion-adsorption deposits supply 80-90% of global heavy rare earth element production, making them
    strategically critical for permanent magnet (Nd-Dy), phosphor (Tb, Eu), and advanced technology supply chains. The microbially
    mediated HREE enrichment creates deposits that are economically extractable through simple in-situ ammonium sulfate leaching,
    avoiding the harsh acids, high temperatures, and radioactive thorium waste associated with conventional hard-rock REE
    mining (bastnaesite, monazite). This natural biogeochemical concentration process represents a sustainable model for selective
    HREE recovery relevant to circular economy and green technology applications.
