name: Coscinodiscus Synthetic Community
description: 'A synthetic marine phytoplankton community consisting of the large centric diatom Coscinodiscus radiatus and
  four phylogenetically distinct bacterial isolates from different marine bacterial lineages. This model system was established
  to examine species-specific diatom-bacteria interactions and community dynamics. The bacteria include two Roseobacteraceae
  members (Mameliella CS4 and Roseovarius Rose1), a gammaproteobacterium (Marinobacter CS1), and a Flavobacterium (Croceibacter
  Crocei1). The consortium demonstrates context-dependent bacterial effects on diatom growth that vary with algal fitness
  state, growth phase, and community composition, with no universal algicidal or growth-promoting bacteria observed. This
  system is relevant to understanding carbon cycling and primary production in marine ecosystems.
