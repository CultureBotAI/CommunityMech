name: PGM Spent Catalyst Bioleaching Consortium
description: 'An engineered acidophilic microbial consortium designed for sustainable recovery of platinum group metals (PGMs)
  from spent automotive catalysts and hydroprocessing catalysts. This bioleaching system employs a two-stage mechanism combining
  Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for alumina support dissolution with biogenic thiosulfate producers for PGM complexation and
  mobilization. Spent three-way catalysts (TWC) from automotive exhaust systems contain precious metals (Pt, Pd, Rh) deposited
  on alumina (Al₂O₃) supports, while spent petroleum refinery hydroprocessing catalysts contain Pd, Ni, Mo, and Al. The consortium
  operates under acidic conditions in column bioreactors, achieving exceptional recovery rates: 93.2% Pd extraction, 82.9%
  Ni, 33.4% Al, and 22.7% Mo from spent petroleum catalysts. The bioleaching mechanism proceeds in two stages: (1) At. thiooxidans
  generates sulfuric acid that dissolves the alumina support matrix, exposing embedded PGM particles, and (2) biogenic thiosulfate
  (S₂O₃²⁻) produced during sulfur oxidation forms stable complexes with Pd and other PGMs in the presence of copper and ammonia,
  mobilizing them from the catalyst surface. The thiosulfate-copper-ammonia system enables selective PGM leaching without
  harsh cyanide reagents. This biotechnological approach offers an environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional
  pyrometallurgical PGM recovery (high-temperature smelting) and aggressive chemical leaching (aqua regia, cyanide), while
  addressing circular economy needs for critical materials recovery from automotive and industrial waste streams. The technology
  represents a significant advance in green metallurgy for spent catalyst recycling.

      also produces thiosulfate (S₂O₃²⁻) as an intermediate during sulfur oxidation, which serves as the key complexing agent
      for PGM mobilization. In the presence of copper and ammonia (thiosulfate-copper-ammonia leaching system), biogenic thiosulfate
      forms stable Pd(S₂O₃)₂²⁻ and other PGM-thiosulfate complexes, achieving 93.2% Pd extraction from spent catalysts. This

  description: 'Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and supporting sulfur oxidizers generate sulfuric acid through oxidation of
    elemental sulfur and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds. The bacterially-produced acid attacks the alumina (γ-Al₂O₃) support
    structure of spent catalysts, dissolving the ceramic matrix and releasing embedded PGM particles. The dissolution reaction
    follows: Al₂O₃ + 3H₂SO₄ → Al₂(SO₄)₃ + 3H₂O, producing soluble aluminum sulfate. For spent petroleum catalysts, this mechanism
    achieves 33.4% Al extraction, demonstrating effective support dissolution. The acidic environment (pH 1.5-3.0) is critical
    for both maximizing alumina dissolution kinetics and maintaining sulfur oxidizer activity. As the alumina matrix dissolves,
    PGM particles (typically 1-5 nm nanoparticles dispersed on the support) are liberated from their embedded positions, increasing
    their surface area and accessibility for subsequent thiosulfate complexation. This represents the first stage of the two-step
    bioleaching mechanism and is essential for exposing PGMs to leaching agents. The process avoids high-temperature calcination
    or aggressive chemical digestion (aqua regia) used in conventional catalyst recycling.

  description: 'Biogenic thiosulfate (S₂O₃²⁻) produced as an intermediate during bacterial sulfur oxidation serves as the
    primary complexing agent for PGM mobilization. At. thiooxidans and other sulfur oxidizers generate thiosulfate during
    incomplete oxidation of S⁰ and RISC, with thiosulfate accumulating in the bioleaching solution. In the presence of copper
    ions (Cu²⁺ or Cu⁺) and ammonia (NH₃/NH₄⁺), thiosulfate forms highly stable complexes with palladium and other PGMs through
    the thiosulfate-copper-ammonia (TCA) leaching system. For palladium, the primary reaction is: Pd⁰ + 2S₂O₃²⁻ + Cu²⁺ + NH₃
    → Pd(S₂O₃)₂²⁻ + Cu-NH₃ complexes. This mechanism achieves exceptional 93.2% Pd extraction from spent petroleum catalysts.
    The TCA system offers critical advantages over conventional cyanide leaching: (1) thiosulfate is non-toxic and environmentally
    benign, (2) the process operates at moderate pH (3-8) without extreme acidity, (3) selectivity for PGMs over base metals,
    and (4) compatibility with biological systems. The biological generation of thiosulfate integrates leaching agent production
    with the bioleaching process itself, eliminating need for external thiosulfate addition and representing a truly green
    metallurgy approach. The stable Pd-thiosulfate complexes remain in solution for recovery by precipitation, electrowinning,
    or ion exchange.

- name: Thiosulfate Metabolic Cycling
  description: 'Thiosulfate (S₂O₃²⁻) occupies a central position in the sulfur oxidation metabolism of the bioleaching consortium,
    serving dual roles as a metabolic intermediate and PGM complexing agent. During oxidation of elemental sulfur and reduced
    sulfur compounds, At. thiooxidans and other sulfur oxidizers produce thiosulfate through incomplete oxidation pathways.
    The thiosulfate can either be: (1) further oxidized to sulfate (S₂O₃²⁻ → SO₄²⁻) to generate energy and sulfuric acid,
    or (2) accumulate in solution where it complexes with PGMs. The balance between thiosulfate oxidation and accumulation
    is critical for bioleaching efficiency. Conditions that favor thiosulfate accumulation (moderate pH, presence of copper/ammonia,
    partial sulfur oxidation) enhance PGM complexation, while complete oxidation to sulfate maximizes alumina dissolution.
    This metabolic flexibility enables the consortium to perform both alumina support dissolution (via sulfuric acid) and
    PGM mobilization (via thiosulfate) in integrated or staged processes. The biological control of thiosulfate levels through
    microbial metabolism represents a unique advantage over chemical PGM leaching where thiosulfate must be externally added
    and controlled.

  unit: qualitative
  description: 'Spent catalysts are crushed and packed into column bioreactors for continuous percolation with acidophilic
    microbial consortium. The column setup enables efficient mass transfer of oxygen, nutrients, and metabolic products through
    the catalyst bed. Continuous flow maintains fresh bacterial culture supply, removes inhibitory metal concentrations from
    active leaching zones, and collects pregnant leach solution (PLS) containing recovered PGMs. Column configuration allows
    independent control of residence time, flow rate, and pH for optimizing sequential alumina dissolution and PGM complexation
    stages. This engineering approach maximizes contact between microbes, substrates, and leaching agents while enabling scalable
    industrial processing.

  value: 93.2% Pd, 82.9% Ni, 22.7% Mo
  unit: '% extraction'
  description: 'Quantitative recovery performance from spent petroleum hydroprocessing catalysts demonstrates industrial viability
    of bioleaching approach. The exceptional 93.2% Pd extraction is attributed to the combined effects of alumina support
    dissolution (exposing embedded Pd particles) and biogenic thiosulfate-copper-ammonia complexation (mobilizing Pd into
    solution). Co-recovery of Ni (82.9%) and Mo (22.7%) demonstrates applicability to polymetallic catalyst systems. For spent
    automotive three-way catalysts, similar mechanisms enable recovery of Pt, Pd, and Rh. These recovery rates are competitive
    with conventional chemical leaching (aqua regia ~95% Pd) while avoiding toxic reagents and harsh conditions, establishing
    bioleaching as a sustainable alternative for critical materials recovery.

- name: Thiosulfate-Copper-Ammonia System
  value: S₂O₃²⁻ + Cu²⁺/Cu⁺ + NH₃/NH₄⁺
  unit: qualitative
  description: 'Synergistic chemical system where biogenic thiosulfate, copper ions, and ammonia work together to mobilize
    PGMs through stable complex formation. The thiosulfate serves as primary ligand coordinating Pd and other PGMs (forming
    Pd(S₂O₃)₂²⁻), while copper acts as co-catalyst and ammonia modulates pH and provides secondary ligand effects. This tripartite
    system achieves superior PGM extraction compared to thiosulfate alone, with the biological production of thiosulfate by
    At. thiooxidans integrating leaching agent generation with the bioleaching process itself. The TCA system operates effectively
    across pH range 3-8, offering flexibility for two-stage processes where acidic alumina dissolution (pH 1.5-3.0) is followed
    by less acidic PGM complexation (pH 3-8). This green chemistry approach replaces toxic cyanide leaching while achieving
    comparable or superior PGM recovery.

- name: Substrate Type
  value: Spent TWC and hydroprocessing catalysts
  unit: qualitative
  description: 'Two primary catalyst waste streams targeted by bioleaching: (1) Spent automotive three-way catalysts (TWC)
    containing Pt, Pd, Rh on alumina ceramic monoliths from vehicle exhaust systems, and (2) spent petroleum refinery hydroprocessing
    catalysts containing Pd, Ni, Mo on alumina supports from desulfurization and hydrocracking units. Both substrates share
    common alumina (γ-Al₂O₃) support structure susceptible to biogenic acid dissolution, but differ in PGM composition and
    concentrations. TWC catalysts contain higher PGM loadings (1-3 g/kg total PGM) while hydroprocessing catalysts contain
    lower Pd with significant Ni and Mo. The bioleaching approach is adaptable to both substrate types through the dual mechanism
    of alumina dissolution and thiosulfate-PGM complexation, addressing diverse spent catalyst recycling needs for circular
    economy applications.
