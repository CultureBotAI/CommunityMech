name: Wheat Synthetic Consortium C6
description: 'A synthetic 4-member rhizosphere consortium (C6) for biocontrol of Rhizoctonia solani in wheat. The consortium
  includes Janthinobacterium lividum BJ, Pseudomonas sp. P25, and two additional rhizosphere bacteria. Together, they provide
  effective suppression of R. solani AG8, a major soilborne pathogen causing root disease in wheat, through synergistic antimicrobial
  activity and plant growth promotion.

engineering_design:
  objective: Study biocontrol of Rhizoctonia solani AG8 with the C6 wheat-rhizosphere synthetic consortium; this record currently captures three named members from the reported four-member design.
  assembly_strategy: Bottom-up assembly from wheat rhizosphere isolates selected for antifungal compatibility; the reported C6 design is four members, with three explicitly curated here.
  measurement_endpoints:
  - Interaction-level mechanistic characterization
  - Member-level abundance and persistence tracking
  notes: Backfilled engineering-design metadata from existing curation; refine with protocol-level parameters when available.
