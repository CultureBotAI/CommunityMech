name: Desulfovibrio-Methanococcus Syntrophic Consortium
description: 'A syntrophic, obligate two-member anaerobic consortium consisting of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, which
  oxidizes lactate to acetate, H2, and CO2 in the absence of sulfate, and Methanococcus maripaludis S2, a hydrogenotrophic
  methanogen. D. vulgaris can reduce sulfate when available, but in sulfate-free environments it must grow syntrophically
  by coupling lactate oxidation to interspecies hydrogen transfer. M. maripaludis consumes the H2 and CO2 produced by D. vulgaris
  to produce methane, maintaining the low H2 partial pressure thermodynamically required for continued lactate oxidation.
  This syntrophic relationship is fundamental to understanding microbial metabolism in sulfate-depleted anaerobic environments
  and represents a classic model system for studying syntrophic electron transfer mechanisms.
