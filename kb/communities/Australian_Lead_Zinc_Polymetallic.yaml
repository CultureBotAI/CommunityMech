description: 'A stratified microbial community from abandoned polymetallic mine tailings in Western Australia, characterized
  by vertical zonation of acidophilic and anaerobic organisms across steep pH and redox gradients. This system represents
  a naturally acidifying sulfidic tailings dump where oxidative weathering of Pb-Zn sulfide minerals drives extreme environmental
  heterogeneity and microhabitat specialization. The upper oxidized layer (pH 1.5-3.0) is dominated by iron- and sulfur-oxidizing
  acidophiles including Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (dual Fe/S oxidation) and Leptospirillum ferriphilum (specialized Fe
  oxidation), which generate ferric iron and sulfuric acid that mobilize lead, zinc, copper, and iron from sulfide minerals
  including galena (PbS), sphalerite (ZnS), and chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂). The intermediate chemocline exhibits dramatic pH transitions
  (pH 3-5) where Ferroplasma acidarmanus thrives in highly acidic microniches while facultative acidophiles transition to
  neutral conditions. The deeper sediment layer (pH 5-7) harbors anaerobic metal-reducing bacteria including Geobacter metallireducens
  that reduce ferric iron to ferrous iron using organic carbon, creating redox cycling between oxic and anoxic zones. Metagenome-assembled
  genomes (MAGs) reveal extensive microhabitat partitioning, with distinct populations specializing in surface oxidation,
  chemocline transitions, or deep anaerobic processes. Metal concentrations reach toxic levels (Pb: hundreds mg/kg, Zn: thousands
  mg/kg, Cu: hundreds mg/kg, Fe: up to 30% w/w), selecting for metal-resistant populations. This abandoned tailings system
  demonstrates natural biogeochemical cycling without active mining, with microbial communities driving ongoing metal mobilization
  (upper layers) and potential natural attenuation (deeper layers). The MAG-resolved metagenomics approach reveals cryptic
  microbial diversity including novel acidophilic lineages adapted to polymetallic stress, providing insights into bioremediation
  strategies and microbial evolution in extreme anthropogenic environments.

  notes: 'Abandoned sulfidic mine tailings from a volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit in arid Western Australia containing
    polymetallic mineralization (Pb-Zn-Cu-Fe). The tailings exhibit vertical stratification with distinct geochemical zones:
    upper oxidized layer (0-1m depth, pH 1.5-3.0, oxic, high Fe³⁺, active acid generation), intermediate chemocline (1-3m
    depth, pH 3-5, oxygen gradients, pH transitions), and deeper reduced sediment layer (>3m depth, pH 5-7, anoxic, high Fe²⁺,
    organic matter accumulation). Primary sulfide minerals include galena (PbS), sphalerite (ZnS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂),
    and pyrite (FeS₂) undergoing oxidative dissolution. The arid climate with sporadic rainfall creates wetting-drying cycles
    that accelerate mineral weathering and concentrate solutes. Metal concentrations are extreme: lead (200-800 mg/kg), zinc
    (2000-8000 mg/kg), copper (300-1200 mg/kg), and iron (up to 30% w/w). Dissolved metal concentrations in pore water reach:
    Pb 5-50 mg/L, Zn 50-500 mg/L, Cu 20-150 mg/L, Fe 1000-10000 mg/L. The tailings have been abandoned for decades, allowing
    natural microbial succession and establishment of stratified communities adapted to polyextreme conditions (acidity, metals,
    redox gradients, oligotrophy).

      oligotrophic tailings environments. The organism exhibits high tolerance to heavy metals including Pb, Zn, and Cu through

    oxidant) and reduced sulfur compounds (generating H₂SO₄ acid), while L. ferriphilum specializes in Fe²⁺ oxidation at lower

    high metal solubility and preventing precipitation of metal hydroxides or carbonates. This cooperative bioleaching mobilizes
    hundreds of mg/kg of lead and thousands of mg/kg of zinc from the tailings matrix into pore water and drainage. The process
    creates extreme dissolved metal concentrations (Pb: 5-50 mg/L, Zn: 50-500 mg/L) that pose environmental contamination
    risks. The released Fe²⁺ is re-oxidized by the bacterial community, creating a closed iron redox cycle that perpetuates

    while deeper neutral zones (pH 5-7) support Geobacter and other neutrophiles. Metagenome-assembled genome analysis reveals
    pH-dependent functional specialization: extreme acidophile MAGs enriched in genes for pH homeostasis (proton-translocating
    ATPases, potassium transporters, impermeant membrane lipids), heavy metal resistance (cop, czc, mer, ars operons), and
    chemolithoautotrophic metabolism (carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation, iron/sulfur oxidation). Deeper MAGs enriched in
    genes for anaerobic respiration (Fe³⁺ reduction, sulfate reduction), organic carbon utilization (TCA cycle, fermentation
    pathways), and neutral pH adaptations. This pH-driven niche differentiation maximizes microbial diversity across the tailings
    profile, with an estimated 100-200 distinct MAG populations exhibiting microhabitat preferences. The spatial segregation
    prevents direct competition, allowing coexistence of phylogenetically and metabolically diverse organisms within the stratified
    system. The microhabitat specialization also creates biogeochemical zonation, with metal mobilization concentrated in
    acidic upper layers and potential metal immobilization in neutral deeper layers.

- name: Copper Mobilization and Toxicity Interactions
  description: 'Copper mobilization from chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂) and other Cu-sulfides creates toxic conditions (20-150 mg/L
    dissolved Cu²⁺) that select for copper-resistant populations and shape community composition. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans
    oxidizes chalcopyrite through combined ferric iron attack and direct enzymatic oxidation, releasing copper, iron, and
    sulfate. However, high copper concentrations inhibit iron oxidation activity, creating a negative feedback where copper
    accumulation slows bioleaching kinetics. Copper-resistant populations carrying cop operons (copABCD for copper efflux,
    copY for Cu binding) dominate in high-copper microniches, while copper-sensitive populations are restricted to lower-copper
    zones. Metagenome analysis reveals horizontal gene transfer of copper resistance determinants across phylogenetically
    distant lineages, suggesting strong selective pressure drives resistance gene spread in polymetallic tailings. Ferroplasma
    exhibits extraordinary copper tolerance (surviving 500+ mg/L Cu²⁺), becoming dominant in copper-enriched acidic zones
    where bacterial acidophiles are inhibited. The copper also influences iron speciation, as Cu²⁺ can oxidize Fe²⁺ chemically
    (2Cu²⁺ + Fe²⁺ → 2Cu⁺ + Fe³⁺), creating abiotic Fe²⁺ oxidation that competes with microbial iron oxidation. Copper toxicity
    creates additional microhabitat heterogeneity beyond pH gradients, with copper-contaminated zones harboring distinct resistant
    populations compared to lower-copper areas at similar pH. This demonstrates how polymetallic contamination creates multidimensional
    niche space where organisms specialize along multiple environmental gradients simultaneously.
