description: >-
  Public KBase narrative for community modeling and flux balance analysis of a synthetic
  bacterial community in R2A medium. The workflow applies gapfilling, merged community model
  construction, and FBA for a Populus-associated SynCom context.

  objective: Public KBase narrative for community modeling and flux balance analysis of a synthetic bacterial community in R2A medium.
  assembly_strategy: Bottom-up synthetic assembly of a 3-member consortium from selected isolates/strains.
  measurement_endpoints:
  - 16S amplicon-based community composition profiling
  - Member-level abundance and persistence tracking
  notes: Backfilled engineering-design metadata from existing curation; refine with protocol-level parameters when available.

    snippet: In this study, 10 bacterial strains isolated from the Populus deltoides rhizosphere were combined and passaged in two different media environments to form stable microbial communities.
    explanation: Supports this KBase narrative's PD10 synthetic community modeling context.
