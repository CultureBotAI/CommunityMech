name: AMD Nitrososphaerota Archaeal Community
description: 'A novel archaeal community from acid mine drainage environments dominated by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA)
  of the phylum Nitrososphaerota (formerly Thaumarchaeota). This community represents a unique nitrogen-cycling system operating
  at extremely low pH (2.5-4.5) where archaeal nitrifiers outcompete bacterial ammonia oxidizers. The dominant members include
  acidophilic AOA such as Candidatus Nitrosotalea devanaterra and Nitrososphaera-like archaea that possess extraordinary substrate
  affinity (Km 0.6-2.8 nM for NH3) and specialized adaptations for acidophily. These archaea oxidize ammonia to nitrite through
  the copper-containing ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) enzyme while maintaining cytoplasmic pH homeostasis in extremely acidic
  environments. The community also includes supporting acidophilic archaea from Thermoplasmata (Ferroplasma, Acidiplasma)
  that provide ecosystem services including organic matter processing and metal tolerance. Unique features include: (1) Amt-type
  ammonium transporters enabling NH4+ uptake rather than NH3 diffusion, (2) urea hydrolysis pathways providing localized ammonia
  generation, (3) extensive cell surface glycosylation reducing proton permeability, and (4) metabolic cooperation with nitrite-oxidizing
  bacteria (Nitrospira, Leptospirillum) completing the nitrification pathway. This system demonstrates how archaeal nitrifiers
  dominate nitrogen cycling in acidic environments where bacterial counterparts cannot function, with AOA abundance 3-10 fold
  higher than AOB in AMD sediments. The community thrives in acid sulfate soils, acid mine drainage sediments, and acidic
  tailings, representing a critical component of nitrogen cycling in the 30% of Earth''s soils with pH <5.5. Based on genomic
  data from NCBI BioProject PRJNA1261802 and related AMD archaeal community studies.

  notes: 'Acidic (pH 2.5-4.5) aquatic and sediment environments impacted by acid mine drainage from sulfide mineral oxidation.
    High concentrations of ammonium (up to 380 mg/L NH4+-N) result from microbial degradation of organic nitrogen in sediments
    and leaching from surrounding soils. The low pH converts most ammonia to ammonium (NH4+), creating nitrogen-rich but substrate-limited
    conditions for ammonia oxidizers. Metal concentrations (Fe, Cu, Zn, As) are elevated but not extreme compared to pH <1.0
    AMD systems. Sulfate concentrations are high (>500 mg/L). Temperature ranges 15-25°C in surface sediments. The environment
    selects for acidophilic ammonia-oxidizing archaea with high substrate affinity and ammonium transporter systems. Oxygen
    availability is variable, with aerobic surface sediments transitioning to microaerobic deeper layers.

- name: Archaeal Ammonia Oxidation to Nitrite
  description: 'Candidatus Nitrosotalea and Nitrososphaera-like archaea oxidize ammonia to nitrite as the first step of nitrification
    in acidic AMD environments. The process begins with NH4+ transport via Amt-type ammonium transporters across the cytoplasmic
    membrane, bypassing the need for NH3 diffusion that is limiting at low pH due to >99.9% protonation of ammonia. Alternatively,
    AOA hydrolyze urea (CO(NH2)2) through urease enzymes, generating localized ammonia (2NH3 + CO2) that is immediately oxidized.
    The copper-containing ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) catalyzes: NH3 + O2 + 2H+ + 2e- → NH2OH + H2O (ammonia to hydroxylamine).
    Hydroxylamine oxidoreductase then converts: NH2OH + H2O → HNO2 + 4H+ + 4e- (hydroxylamine to nitrite). The 4 electrons
    are returned to AMO and respiratory chain, generating ATP through chemiosmotic coupling. CO2 is fixed through the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate
    (3HP/4HB) pathway. Archaeal ammonia oxidation proceeds at pH 2.5-5.5 where bacterial AOB are inactive, with maximum rates
    at pH 4.0-4.5. The high substrate affinity (Km 0.6-2.8 nM NH3) enables activity at nanomolar free ammonia concentrations
    despite millimolar ammonium levels. Nitrite production rate: 5-20 nmol NO2-/10^7 cells/day. This process initiates the
    nitrogen cycle in acidic AMD, providing nitrite substrate for nitrite oxidizers.

  description: 'Nitrospira-like nitrite-oxidizing bacteria oxidize nitrite produced by archaeal ammonia oxidizers to nitrate,

    2e-. The two electrons are transferred to the quinone pool and used to generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.
    Some electrons are used in reverse electron transport to generate NADH for CO2 fixation via the reverse TCA (rTCA) cycle.
    This syntrophic partnership is critical because: (1) Nitrospira provides a sink for nitrite, preventing toxic accumulation
    (>10 mg/L NO2-) that would inhibit AOA activity, (2) rapid nitrite consumption maintains concentration gradients favoring
    continued ammonia oxidation, (3) complete oxidation to nitrate prevents buildup of reactive nitrogen intermediates, and
    (4) nitrate is more stable and less toxic than nitrite in AMD. Comammox Nitrospira strains can independently oxidize both
    ammonia and nitrite, competing with AOA for ammonia substrate in some environments but also providing functional redundancy.
    Nitrospira operates at pH 3.2-5.0, matching the pH range of acidophilic AOA. The stoichiometry links AOA and Nitrospira:
    2 mol NH3 oxidized by AOA produces 2 mol NO2- consumed by Nitrospira to generate 2 mol NO3-. In high-ammonium AMD sediments,
    comammox Nitrospira and AOA co-dominate, both contributing to nitrogen oxidation.

  description: 'Archaeal ammonia oxidizers hydrolyze urea to generate localized ammonia, overcoming substrate limitation at
    low pH. In acidic AMD environments (pH 2.5-4.5), >99.9% of ammonia exists as protonated ammonium (NH4+), reducing free
    ammonia to nanomolar concentrations insufficient for diffusion-based uptake. Urea (CO(NH2)2) from organic matter decomposition,
    animal excretion, or fertilizer runoff provides an alternative nitrogen source. Archaeal urease (ureC gene) catalyzes:
    CO(NH2)2 + H2O → 2NH3 + CO2. The ammonia is generated within the periplasmic space or at the cell surface, creating high
    local concentrations (μM range) before protonation to ammonium. This ammonia is immediately oxidized by ammonia monooxygenase
    before diffusion away from the cell. The process enables AOA to function in environments where free ammonia is thermodynamically
    limiting. Urea concentrations in AMD sediments range 0.5-5 mg/L depending on organic matter inputs. Urea addition experiments
    show 2-5 fold stimulation of archaeal nitrification in acidic soils compared to ammonium additions, demonstrating the
    importance of this pathway. The urease pathway provides metabolic flexibility: AOA can use either NH4+ (via Amt transporters)

    through the 3HP/4HB carbon fixation pathway.

    Candidatus Nitrosotalea optimum pH 4.0-5.5, Nitrososphaera-like archaea pH 3.5-5.0, Ferroplasma pH 0.7-2.5, Nitrospira
    pH 3.2-5.0. pH affects: (1) ammonia/ammonium speciation (pKa 9.25), (2) nitrite/nitrous acid speciation affecting toxicity,
    (3) metal solubility and bioavailability, (4) membrane proton gradients affecting ATP synthesis, and (5) activity of acid-
    labile enzymes. The archaeal community structure shifts with pH, with Nitrosotalea dominating pH 4.0-5.0 zones and transitioning
    to Ferroplasma-dominated communities at pH <3.0.

- name: Ammonium Concentration
  value: 50-380
  unit: mg/L NH4+-N
  description: 'AMD sediments contain elevated ammonium concentrations (50-380 mg/L NH4+-N, equivalent to 3.5-27 mM) from
    microbial degradation of organic nitrogen in sediments, leaching from surrounding soils, and nitrogen mineralization.
    At pH 3.5-4.5, virtually all ammonia is protonated to NH4+ (>99.9%), resulting in millimolar ammonium but only nanomolar
    free ammonia. This creates a "substrate-rich but ammonia-poor" environment where total nitrogen is abundant but bioavailable
    ammonia is limiting. Archaeal ammonia oxidizers solve this problem through: (1) Amt-type ammonium transporters actively
    transporting NH4+ across membranes, and (2) high-affinity ammonia monooxygenase with Km 0.6-2.8 nM for NH3. Ammonium concentration
    correlates with AOA abundance (r2 = 0.65-0.78) and nitrification rates. Optimal ammonium for archaeal nitrification: 50-200
    mg/L. At >300 mg/L, inhibition may occur due to ionic strength effects. Ammonium sources include: urea hydrolysis, amino
    acid deamination, organic matter mineralization, and atmospheric deposition. Consumption rate: 5-20 μg NH4+-N/g sediment/day
    depending on AOA abundance and temperature.

- name: Temperature
  value: 15-25
  unit: °C
  description: 'AMD sediments experience mesophilic temperatures (15-25°C) in surface and near- surface layers, with seasonal
    variation of ±5-10°C depending on climate and depth. Surface sediments track ambient air temperature while deeper sediments
    (>20 cm) maintain more stable temperatures. The mesophilic range favors Candidatus Nitrosotalea and Nitrososphaera-like
    archaea (optimum 20-30°C) over thermophilic iron oxidizers like Acidithiobacillus caldus (optimum 45°C). Temperature affects:
    (1) archaeal growth rates (Q10 = 2-3 for AOA), (2) ammonia monooxygenase activity, (3) membrane fluidity requiring adjustment
    of GDGT lipid composition, (4) oxygen solubility (higher at low temperature), and (5) ammonia volatilization (minimal
    at <25°C). Some AMD sites exhibit thermal stratification with warmer surface waters (20-25°C) and cooler deeper sediments
    (15-18°C). Nitrification rates peak at 20-25°C, decrease 50% at 10°C, and are negligible at <5°C. Seasonal temperature
    variation drives changes in community composition and activity, with highest nitrification rates in spring and fall when
    temperatures are optimal.

- name: Oxygen Availability
  value: Aerobic surface to microaerobic depth
  unit: qualitative
  description: 'AMD sediments exhibit oxygen gradients from aerobic surface layers (>6 mg/L O2) to microaerobic deeper sediments
    (<2 mg/L O2). Surface sediments in contact with water column are well-oxygenated through diffusion and water movement.
    Oxygen penetration depth: 5-15 mm depending on organic matter content and microbial respiration rates. Archaeal ammonia
    oxidizers are obligate aerobes requiring O2 as co-substrate for ammonia monooxygenase (NH3 + O2 + 2H+ + 2e- → NH2OH +
    H2O). Km for O2 is typically 2-10 μM for AOA, enabling activity at low oxygen concentrations. Nitrospira also require
    O2 for nitrite oxidation but have slightly higher oxygen requirements. Ferroplasma is microaerophilic, growing optimally
    at 1-3 mg/L O2 and tolerating microaerobic conditions. Oxygen availability determines vertical zonation: aerobic surface
    (0-5 mm) dominated by Nitrosotalea and Nitrospira; microaerobic subsurface (5-15 mm) with mixed AOA and Ferroplasma; anaerobic
    deep sediments (>15 mm) with fermentative and sulfate-reducing populations. Oxygen consumption rates: 2-5 μmol O2/g sediment/day
    driven by aerobic respiration. Seasonal oxygen depletion can occur in summer due to increased temperature and respiration,
    temporarily shifting community to more anaerobic metabolism.

  description: 'NCBI BioProject PRJNA1261802 represents a genomic sequencing initiative targeting novel ammonia-oxidizing
    archaea (AOA) from acid mine drainage environments. The project encompasses 54 gigabases of sequencing data yielding approximately
    3 high- quality archaeal genomes (estimated 2-3 Mb per genome = 6-9 Mb total, with high coverage depth 1000-6000X). Genomes
    likely represent: (1) Candidatus Nitrosotalea- like acidophilic AOA with amoA/amoB/amoC genes, Amt ammonium transporter,
    urease, and 3HP/4HB carbon fixation pathway; (2) Nitrososphaera-like mesophilic AOA adapted to moderately acidic conditions;
    and (3) supporting archaeon (possibly Ferroplasma or Acidiplasma) providing ecosystem services. Genomic data provides
    evidence for: acidophily mechanisms (kdp K+ transporter, mgtA Mg2+ transporter, Na+/H+ exchangers, carbonic anhydrase,
    acetolactate decarboxylase), GDGT-4 lipid biosynthesis, extensive cell surface glycosylation genes, and horizontal gene
