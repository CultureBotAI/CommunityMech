name: Chlorella-Rhizobium Bioflocculation
description: >
  A co-culture system pairing the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris with the
  bioflocculant-producing bacterium Rhizobium radiobacter F2 for enhanced
  algal harvesting in wastewater treatment applications. The bacterium produces
  extracellular polysaccharide bioflocculants that induce aggregation and
  flocculation of algal cells, enabling efficient biomass recovery for biofuel
  production. This bioflocculation approach avoids the negative effects of
  traditional chemical flocculants and provides a cost-effective, environmentally
  friendly method for microalgae harvesting, with flocculation efficiency
  improving from 0.2% (axenic algae) to >90% with bacterial co-culture.

    description: >
      Rhizobium radiobacter F2 produces extracellular polysaccharide bioflocculants
      that induce aggregation and flocculation of Chlorella cells. The bacteria
      utilize glucose and potentially algal exudates as carbon sources to synthesize
      the bioflocculant polymers. These polymers bind to algal cell surfaces,
      neutralize surface charges, and bridge cells together to form dense flocs
      that settle rapidly, enabling efficient harvesting.
