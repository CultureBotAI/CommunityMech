  objective: BioModels record MODEL2405300001 contains genome-scale metabolic models used to study a synthetic human infant gut microbial community in the context of human milk oligosaccharides.
  assembly_strategy: Bottom-up synthetic assembly from selected taxa described in the source study.
  measurement_endpoints:
  - Community composition and functional performance readouts
  notes: Backfilled engineering-design metadata from existing curation; refine with protocol-level parameters when available.
