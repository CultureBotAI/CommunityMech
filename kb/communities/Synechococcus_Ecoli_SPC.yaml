name: Synechococcus-E.coli Synthetic Photosynthetic Consortium
description: 'A synthetic, light-driven consortium pairing the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (engineered
  to secrete sucrose via the cscB+ transporter) with Escherichia coli. The cyanobacterium fixes CO2 and exports up to 85%
  of fixed carbon as sucrose, which supports heterotrophic growth of E. coli. This modular platform enables stable, long-term
  photosynthetic co-culture for biofuel precursor production and demonstrates a synthetic cross-feeding interaction that persists
  over days to months.
