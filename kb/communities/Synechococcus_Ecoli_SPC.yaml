name: Synechococcus-E.coli Synthetic Photosynthetic Consortium
description: >
  A synthetic, light-driven consortium pairing the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus
  PCC 7942 (engineered to secrete sucrose via the cscB+ transporter) with Escherichia coli.
  The cyanobacterium fixes CO2 and exports up to 85% of fixed carbon as sucrose, which
  supports heterotrophic growth of E. coli. This modular platform enables stable,
  long-term photosynthetic co-culture for biofuel precursor production and demonstrates
  a synthetic cross-feeding interaction that persists over days to months.

# Ecological interactions - causal graph
ecological_interactions:
  - name: CO2 Fixation and Sucrose Production
    description: >
      Synechococcus elongatus fixes atmospheric CO2 through photosynthesis and converts
      the fixed carbon into sucrose. The CscB transporter enables export of sucrose to
      the extracellular environment when induced with IPTG in the presence of osmotic
      pressure (NaCl).

  - name: Sucrose Uptake and Heterotrophic Growth
    description: >
      E. coli utilizes the sucrose secreted by Synechococcus elongatus as its carbon
      and energy source for heterotrophic growth. This establishes a stable syntrophic
      relationship where the phototroph provides fixed carbon and the heterotroph
      benefits without needing to fix CO2.
