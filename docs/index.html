                <h2>AMD Acidophile Heterotroph Network</h2>
                <p class="description">A heterotrophic microbial network in acid mine drainage (AMD) systems dominated by Acidiphilium species and related acidophilic heterotrophs. This community plays a crucial role in coupling carbon and iron cycles in extremely acidic environments, supporting autotrophic iron oxidizers through organic matter processing and nutrient remineralization. The network thrives at pH 2-4 in AMD sites globally, where heterotrophs metabolize organic compounds produced by autotrophs or released from lysed cells, preventing organic carbon accumulation that would inhibit autotrophic iron oxidizers. Key members include Acidiphilium multivorum (facultative Fe(III) reducer and organic carbon degrader), Ferrimicrobium acidiphilum (iron-oxidizing heterotroph and dissolved organic carbon remover), Acidocella facilis (obligate aerobic heterotroph), Acidisphaera rubrifaciens (photoheterotrophic bacteriochlorophyll producer), and Acidobacterium capsulatum (chemoorganotrophic acidophile). These organisms collectively perform organic matter degradation, ferric iron reduction, biofilm formation, and nutrient cycling. The heterotroph-autotroph coupling maintains community stability by removing inhibitory organic carbon, recycling nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus), generating ferrous iron for autotrophic energy generation, and facilitating metal tolerance through extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production. This network represents a critical functional guild in AMD ecosystems, enabling the persistence of autotrophic iron-oxidizing communities through metabolic cooperation and resource partitioning.

                <h2>AMD Nitrososphaerota Archaeal Community</h2>
                <p class="description">A novel archaeal community from acid mine drainage environments dominated by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) of the phylum Nitrososphaerota (formerly Thaumarchaeota). This community represents a unique nitrogen-cycling system operating at extremely low pH (2.5-4.5) where archaeal nitrifiers outcompete bacterial ammonia oxidizers. The dominant members include acidophilic AOA such as Candidatus Nitrosotalea devanaterra and Nitrososphaera-like archaea that possess extraordinary substrate affinity (Km 0.6-2.8 nM for NH3) and specialized adaptations for acidophily. These archaea oxidize ammonia to nitrite through the copper-containing ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) enzyme while maintaining cytoplasmic pH homeostasis in extremely acidic environments. The community also includes supporting acidophilic archaea from Thermoplasmata (Ferroplasma, Acidiplasma) that provide ecosystem services including organic matter processing and metal tolerance. Unique features include: (1) Amt-type ammonium transporters enabling NH4+ uptake rather than NH3 diffusion, (2) urea hydrolysis pathways providing localized ammonia generation, (3) extensive cell surface glycosylation reducing proton permeability, and (4) metabolic cooperation with nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospira, Leptospirillum) completing the nitrification pathway. This system demonstrates how archaeal nitrifiers dominate nitrogen cycling in acidic environments where bacterial counterparts cannot function, with AOA abundance 3-10 fold higher than AOB in AMD sediments. The community thrives in acid sulfate soils, acid mine drainage sediments, and acidic tailings, representing a critical component of nitrogen cycling in the 30% of Earth's soils with pH <5.5. Based on genomic data from NCBI BioProject PRJNA1261802 and related AMD archaeal community studies.

                <h2>Aspergillus Indium LED Recovery Platform</h2>
                <p class="description">An engineered fungal monoculture bioplatform based on Aspergillus niger for sustainable recovery of indium from waste liquid crystal display (LCD) and light-emitting diode (LED) panels through indirect bioleaching. This system represents a green alternative to conventional harsh chemical extraction methods (concentrated acids at high temperatures), utilizing fungal organic acid production to mobilize and recover critical materials from electronic waste. A. niger produces a cocktail of organic acids including oxalic acid (14.9 g/L), gluconic acid (1.2 g/L), citric acid (0.9 g/L), and malic acid (0.39 g/L) during growth on glucose-based medium. The spent culture filtrate achieves remarkable indium recovery performance: 100% indium yield from waste LCD/LED panels in just 1.5 hours at 70°C, with final indium concentration of 145.6 mg/L. The bioleaching mechanism involves H+ ions from acidic functional groups (-COOH) of organic acids and secreted proteins, which dissolve indium-tin oxide (ITO) coatings and indium-bearing components. The process operates at low pH (1.96) due to organic acid accumulation, creating optimal conditions for indium mobilization while avoiding the corrosivity, energy intensity, and hazardous waste generation of conventional acid leaching. This biotechnological approach addresses the critical need for indium recycling, as this element is essential for touchscreens, flat-panel displays, and optoelectronics, yet faces supply constraints due to limited primary resources and increasing demand from electronics manufacturing.

                <h2>Australian Lead Zinc Polymetallic Tailings Consortium</h2>
                <p class="description">A stratified microbial community from abandoned polymetallic mine tailings in Western Australia, characterized by vertical zonation of acidophilic and anaerobic organisms across steep pH and redox gradients. This system represents a naturally acidifying sulfidic tailings dump where oxidative weathering of Pb-Zn sulfide minerals drives extreme environmental heterogeneity and microhabitat specialization. The upper oxidized layer (pH 1.5-3.0) is dominated by iron- and sulfur-oxidizing acidophiles including Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (dual Fe/S oxidation) and Leptospirillum ferriphilum (specialized Fe oxidation), which generate ferric iron and sulfuric acid that mobilize lead, zinc, copper, and iron from sulfide minerals including galena (PbS), sphalerite (ZnS), and chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂). The intermediate chemocline exhibits dramatic pH transitions (pH 3-5) where Ferroplasma acidarmanus thrives in highly acidic microniches while facultative acidophiles transition to neutral conditions. The deeper sediment layer (pH 5-7) harbors anaerobic metal-reducing bacteria including Geobacter metallireducens that reduce ferric iron to ferrous iron using organic carbon, creating redox cycling between oxic and anoxic zones. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) reveal extensive microhabitat partitioning, with distinct populations specializing in surface oxidation, chemocline transitions, or deep anaerobic processes. Metal concentrations reach toxic levels (Pb: hundreds mg/kg, Zn: thousands mg/kg, Cu: hundreds mg/kg, Fe: up to 30% w/w), selecting for metal-resistant populations. This abandoned tailings system demonstrates natural biogeochemical cycling without active mining, with microbial communities driving ongoing metal mobilization (upper layers) and potential natural attenuation (deeper layers). The MAG-resolved metagenomics approach reveals cryptic microbial diversity including novel acidophilic lineages adapted to polymetallic stress, providing insights into bioremediation strategies and microbial evolution in extreme anthropogenic environments.

                <h2>Bayan Obo REE Tailings Consortium</h2>
                <p class="description">An acid-producing bacterial consortium engineered to extract rare earth elements (REE) from tailings at the Bayan Obo mine in Inner Mongolia, China, the world's largest rare earth deposit. This functional bacterial consortium achieves exceptional REE recovery rates of 82-83% for the five main light rare earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) after 18 days of bioleaching using one-step or two-step processes. The tailings are iron extraction residues from medium-poor oxidized ores containing bastnaesite (REE(CO₃)F) and monazite as primary REE minerals. The consortium employs acid-producing bacteria including actinomycetes (Streptomyces sp.), autotrophic acidophiles (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans), and heterotrophic acidophiles (Acidiphilium cryptum) that work synergistically to mobilize REE through acidolysis and organic acid complexation. Key mechanisms include production of organic acids (citric, oxalic, lactic, pyruvic), siderophores, and complexing ligands that solubilize REE from carbonate-fluoride minerals. The two-step process (sequential inoculation with heterotrophs followed by autotrophs) achieves 83.51% recovery versus 82.78% for one-step (simultaneous inoculation), demonstrating synergistic enhancement through pH control and organic acid accumulation. This system represents a critical sustainable biotechnology for recovering strategic REE materials essential for clean energy technologies, permanent magnets, and electronics while remediating millions of tons of existing Bayan Obo tailings.

                <h2>Chromium Sulfur Reduction Enrichment</h2>
                <p class="description">A novel enrichment culture from chromium-contaminated tailings capable of coupled Cr(VI) reduction and sulfur oxidation, representing a dual detoxification mechanism for bioremediation applications. This engineered community is dominated by Intrasporangiaceae sp. (SOCrRB strain, up to 55-65% relative abundance in enrichments) isolated from chromium mining tailings. The system performs simultaneous Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) coupled with oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (sulfide, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur), creating a unique biogeochemical coupling not previously documented in chromium bioremediation. Intrasporangiaceae sp. reduces toxic hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI), chromate] to trivalent chromium [Cr(III), chromite] with 70-85% efficiency within 48-72 hours at initial Cr(VI) concentrations of 50-200 mg/L. Concurrently, the community oxidizes sulfide and thiosulfate to sulfate, generating reducing equivalents that enhance Cr(VI) reduction rates by 40-60% compared to organic carbon-dependent reduction alone. Supporting bacteria including Pseudomonas species (15-20%) and Bacillus species (10-15%) contribute to sulfur cycling, organic matter degradation, and metal detoxification through biosorption and enzymatic transformation. The enrichment originated from BioProject PRJNA1272773 (13 metagenome samples) targeting chromium-sulfur coupled metabolism in mining-impacted environments. This dual-mechanism system achieves Cr(VI) reduction at circumneutral to alkaline pH (7.0-8.5), distinguishing it from acidic bioremediation approaches, and demonstrates superior performance in sulfate-rich tailings environments typical of chromite ore processing. The technology provides a sustainable alternative to chemical reduction methods for chromium detoxification in contaminated soils, groundwater, and industrial effluents, with potential applications in electroplating waste treatment and leather tanning effluent remediation. Chromium concentrations decrease from 150-200 mg/L to below regulatory limits (<5 mg/L total Cr) within 5-7 days under optimal conditions.

                <p class="description">An engineered bioplatform utilizing the purple pigmented bacterium Chromobacterium violaceum for sustainable gold extraction from refractory ores and electronic waste through biological cyanide production (biocyanidation). This system represents an environmentally-friendly alternative to conventional chemical cyanide leaching, producing controlled amounts of biogenic cyanide that complexes gold as soluble Au(CN)₂⁻ while simultaneously metabolizing excess cyanide to prevent environmental toxicity. C. violaceum is a versatile heterotrophic bacterium that produces the purple pigment violacein and synthesizes cyanide through hydrogen cyanide (HCN) biosynthesis pathways. The bacterium is pre-grown in nutrient medium to stationary phase, then activated for cyanide production upon exposure to ground refractory gold ores or electronic scrap (PCBs, connectors). Operating at near-neutral pH (6.5-7.5) and mesophilic temperature (28-32°C), the system achieves gold extraction efficiencies comparable to chemical cyanidation (70-85% recovery) from refractory sulfide ores and precious metal-bearing e-waste. The process requires ore grinding pretreatment to liberate gold particles and operates in aerated bioreactors with glycerol or glucose as carbon source. Biocyanidation kinetics are slower than chemical leaching (7-14 days vs. 24-48 hours) but offer significant advantages: lower cyanide concentrations (50-200 ppm vs. 500-2000 ppm), ambient temperature operation, biological cyanide detoxification, and reduced environmental liability. The platform enables decentralized gold recovery from low-grade ores and artisanal mining operations while avoiding hazardous chemical transport. Gold is recovered from pregnant leach solution by activated carbon adsorption followed by elution and electrowinning or zinc cementation.

                <p class="description">An industrial microbial consortium used for commercial copper bioleaching from low-grade sulfide ores in heap leach operations. This acidophilic community oxidizes ferrous iron and reduced sulfur compounds, generating ferric iron (Fe³⁺) and sulfuric acid that solubilize copper from chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂) and other copper sulfide minerals. The consortium demonstrates temporal succession over the 200-300 day leaching cycle, with Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans dominating early stages (pH >2, low Fe, ~10⁷ copies/ml at 200 days), followed by Leptospirillum ferriphilum and Ferroplasma acidiphilum in aged heaps (pH 1.67-1.83, high Fe³⁺ ~1.9 g/L, ~10⁵ copies/ml at >250 days). Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans maintains constant sulfur oxidation activity (10⁵ copies/ml) throughout the cycle. Sulfobacillus species contribute at low abundance (10³-10⁴ copies/ml) with increased activity in older heaps. The community operates at pH 1.5-2.5, temperatures 20-60°C depending on thermophilic strains, and produces the Fe³⁺ oxidant critical for copper dissolution (reaching 1.86-1.9 g/L Fe³⁺). This biohydrometallurgical process extracts copper from ores uneconomical for conventional smelting, with industrial operations achieving commercial-scale metal recovery through percolation of acidic leach solutions through heaps of crushed ore.

                <p class="description">A synthetic marine phytoplankton community consisting of the large centric diatom Coscinodiscus radiatus and four phylogenetically distinct bacterial isolates from different marine bacterial lineages. This model system was established to examine species-specific diatom-bacteria interactions and community dynamics. The bacteria include two Roseobacteraceae members (Mameliella CS4 and Roseovarius Rose1), a gammaproteobacterium (Marinobacter CS1), and a Flavobacterium (Croceibacter Crocei1). The consortium demonstrates context-dependent bacterial effects on diatom growth that vary with algal fitness state, growth phase, and community composition, with no universal algicidal or growth-promoting bacteria observed.

                <p class="description">A three-member synthetic consortium consisting of Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Dv), Methanococcus maripaludis (Mm), and Methanosarcina barkeri (Mb) that converts lactate to methane under varying sulfate conditions. D. vulgaris oxidizes lactate to acetate, CO2, and H2. Both methanogens (Mm and Mb) can consume the H2 produced by Dv, with Mm being a hydrogenotrophic methanogen and Mb capable of using both H2-CO2 and acetate for methanogenesis. The community demonstrates differential responses to geochemical gradients, particularly sulfate availability. In the absence of sulfate, all three species co-exist and methane production increases by almost 100% compared to Dv-Mm co-cultures. However, increasing sulfate levels shift community dynamics as Dv preferentially uses sulfate as an electron acceptor, creating competitive situations for both methanogens. This system provides insights into how geochemical gradients (particularly sulfate) regulate microbial interactions and methane production in anaerobic environments.

M. maripaludis consumes the H2 and CO2 produced by D. vulgaris to produce methane, maintaining the low H2 partial pressure thermodynamically required for continued lactate oxidation. This syntrophic relationship is fundamental to understanding microbial metabolism in sulfate-depleted anaerobic environments and represents a classic model system for studying syntrophic electron transfer mechanisms.

All 17 members were originally isolated from switchgrass rhizosphere soil and span four bacterial phyla (Actinomycetota, Bacillota, Bacteroidota, Pseudomonadota). In the full SynCom17, Paraburkholderia sp. OAS925 reproducibly dominates root colonization (~98% relative abundance) across all five labs, uniquely possessing a Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS), high motility, and acid resistance. Removing Paraburkholderia (SynCom16) yields a more variable community dominated by Rhodococcus sp. OAS809 (~68%), Mycobacterium sp. OAE908 (~14%), and Methylobacterium sp. OAE515 (~15%). The study demonstrated that EcoFAB 2.0 with standardized protocols achieves reproducible plant phenotype, exudate, and community structure data across continents, providing benchmark datasets for plant-microbiome research.

                <p class="description">An engineered acidophilic microbial consortium adapted for recovering valuable metals from electronic waste, particularly printed circuit boards (PCBs). This consortium consists primarily of iron-oxidizing bacteria dominated by Leptospirillum ferriphilum with Sulfobacillus benefaciens, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans contributing to metal solubilization. The community operates at extremely low pH (1.2 ± 0.1) and moderate temperature (35°C), oxidizing ferrous iron to generate ferric iron (Fe³⁺) that dissolves base metals (copper, zinc, nickel) and mobilizes precious metals (gold, silver, palladium) from PCB components. Metal recovery is exceptional: 100% copper dissolution (2.6-4.2 g/L), 100% zinc (303-543 mg/L), and 70% nickel (30-52 mg/L). However, PCB materials are toxic to the consortium, delaying the pre-oxidation phase from 11 days at 1% PCB load to 18 days at 2% load, with no growth above 8% PCB. Successive subculturing adapts the consortium to PCB toxicity, reducing lag phase by 2.6-fold. This biotechnological approach offers an environmentally-friendly alternative to pyrometallurgical e-waste processing (smelting), avoiding toxic emissions while recovering critical materials including copper for electrical applications and precious metals for electronics manufacturing. The two-step process may include subsequent cyanide-producing heterotrophs (Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. putida) for enhanced gold and silver extraction.

                <p class="description">A synergistic two-member consortium consisting of the cell wall-lacking archaeon Ferroplasma acidiphilum and the iron-oxidizing bacterium Leptospirillum ferriphilum, found in extremely acidic, metal-rich environments including acid mine drainage and biomining operations. This partnership demonstrates mutualistic metabolic cooperation where both organisms oxidize ferrous iron but occupy complementary ecological niches. Ferroplasma grows chemomixotrophically, oxidizing Fe²⁺ while consuming organic matter secreted by Leptospirillum, thereby maintaining low organic compound concentrations that would otherwise inhibit Leptospirillum through toxic effects. In return, Leptospirillum provides organic carbon that Ferroplasma requires for mixotrophic growth. Recent transcriptomic studies show F. acidiphilum upregulates energy and stress resistance genes in L. ferriphilum under organic matter stress. The co-culture outperforms pure cultures in chalcopyrite and pyrite bioleaching, achieving 31.5% higher copper extraction and 31.7% higher ferric iron generation compared to monocultures under yeast extract stress (0.5 g/L). Cell growth is favorably affected by filtered medium from the partner organism, confirming synergistic interaction. This archaeal-bacterial partnership thrives at extremely low pH (pH <2), temperatures 30-50°C, and high metal concentrations, representing a model system for understanding cross-domain syntrophy in extreme environments. The consortium plays major roles in biogeochemical cycling of sulfur and sulfide metals in highly acidic habitats.

G. sulfurreducens acts as an exoelectrogen, oxidizing acetate and transferring electrons directly to C. pasteurianum via electrically conductive pili (nanowires). These electron transfers induce a metabolic shift in C. pasteurianum's glycerol fermentation pathway, redirecting carbon flux away from ethanol and butanol production toward increased 1,3-propanediol (PDO) and butyrate production. This represents a unique application of DIET where electron transfer serves not to drive methanogenesis but to modulate fermentation pathways, achieving a 37% increase in 1,3-propanediol and 38% increase in butyrate production. The bacteria establish physical contact through nanowires, enabling electron exchange without relying on diffusible hydrogen or formate carriers. This coculture demonstrates how controlled interspecies electron transfer can be exploited to optimize production of industrially relevant metabolites like 1,3-propanediol.

                <p class="description">A permanently stratified (meromictic) acidic pit lake community from the Iberian Pyrite Belt in southwestern Spain/Portugal, distinguished by dramatic vertical metabolic zonation and subsurface anaerobic processes in an extreme acid mine drainage environment. The pit lake ecosystem exhibits three distinct layers: an upper oxic mixolimnion (pH 2.2-3.1, 0-3m depth), a chemocline transition zone (11m), and an anoxic monimolimnion (pH 3.0-4.5, 35m depth). The upper layer is dominated by acidophilic green algae (Coccomyxa onubensis) and heterotrophic bacteria (Acidiphilium), while the chemocline hosts intense sulfate reduction and iron cycling by specialized Proteobacteria (Desulfomonile, Candidatus Acidulodesulfobacterium). The deep anoxic layer harbors archaeal heterotrophs (Thermoplasmatales, 46% of sequences) that scavenge organic carbon and perform sulfide oxidation using trace oxygen, along with iron-reducing bacteria (Geobacter) and subsurface methanogens (Methanobrevibacter, Methanospirillum). The permanent stratification creates steep geochemical gradients with iron concentrations increasing from 2 mM Fe³⁺ in surface waters to 113 mM Fe²⁺ at depth, sulfate ranging from 26-126 mM, and oxygen transitioning from oxic to completely anoxic conditions. This system represents a natural laboratory for studying coupled aerobic-anaerobic metabolism, metal cycling, biosulfidogenesis, and subsurface methanogenesis under polyextreme conditions (acidity, metals, anoxia). The Iberian Pyrite Belt pit lakes demonstrate how microbial stratification can support complex biogeochemical cycling and potential natural attenuation of toxic metals through sulfide precipitation.

The community exhibits unique HREE vs LREE fractionation capability, with Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus, Micrococcus) preferentially adsorbing HREE (82-85% efficiency) compared to LREE (70-78%), driven by teichoic acids in cell walls that provide selective phosphate binding sites for heavier lanthanides. Removal of teichoic acids reduces REE adsorption from 65.5% to 17.8%, confirming their critical role. The community accelerates REE mineralization in supergene weathering environments through bioweathering of granite, dissolution of REE-bearing minerals, and biosorption-mediated HREE enrichment. Ion-adsorption deposits represent the world's main source of strategically critical HREE (Dy, Y, Tb, Eu) used in permanent magnets and phosphors, with over 40 deposit sites in South China. The indigenous microbial community functions across pH gradients (4.3-7.0), exhibits oligotrophic K-strategist adaptations (Acidobacteria), and demonstrates co-localization of ytterbium with phosphate-rich cell walls. This natural HREE fractionation system offers a sustainable model for selective REE recovery and explains the geological genesis of commercially valuable HREE-enriched clay deposits.

                <h2>Methylobacterium REE E-waste Platform</h2>
                <p class="description">An engineered monoculture bioplatform based on the mesophilic methylotrophic bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 for sustainable recovery of rare earth elements (REE) from electronic waste. This system represents a paradigm shift in critical materials recovery through non-acidic, green bioprocessing that eliminates the harsh chemical leaching typical of conventional REE extraction. M. extorquens naturally accumulates REE in intracellular polyphosphate granules during methanol metabolism, achieving baseline bioaccumulation of 3.2 mg Nd/g dry cell weight. Through metabolic engineering—overexpression of lanthanophore biosynthesis genes (mll operon under lac promoter control) and deletion of exopolyphosphatase (ppx)—REE bioaccumulation was enhanced to 202 mg Nd/g DCW (63-fold improvement), representing one of the highest microbial REE loading capacities reported. The platform achieves remarkable selectivity with 98% of accumulated metal being REE and 96.8% of that being neodymium, critical for permanent magnet recycling. The system operates at near-neutral pH (6.9), mesophilic temperature (29-30°C), and scales to 10-liter bioreactors with controlled organic acid supplementation (5-15 mM citrate). After bioleaching with citrate, 58.7 ppm REE are mobilized from electronic waste (magnet swarf), followed by cellular bioaccumulation and recovery. This consolidated platform integrates leaching, bioaccumulation, and recovery in a single organism, offering environmental advantages over acidic chemical processing while addressing circular economy needs for critical materials in clean energy technologies.

                <p class="description">An engineered acidophilic microbial consortium specifically designed for recovering gallium from waste light-emitting diodes (LEDs) through non-contact bioleaching. This mixed community consists of three iron- and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in equal proportions (1:1:1 ratio): Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans. The consortium produces biogenic lixiviants - primarily sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) from sulfur oxidation and ferric iron (Fe³⁺) from iron oxidation - that solubilize gallium from GaN-based LED materials without direct contact between microbes and solid waste. Operating at pH 1.0-1.5 and 15 g/L pulp density, the system achieves exceptional 99.5% gallium leaching efficiency within just 3 days. The non-contact bioleaching approach separates the bioreactor (where microbes generate lixiviants) from the leaching reactor (where acids attack LED waste), preventing microbial inhibition by toxic LED components while enabling gallium recovery. In addition to gallium, the process recovers copper and nickel from LED substrates and interconnects. This biotechnological platform offers a sustainable alternative to harsh chemical leaching methods, utilizing microbial metabolism to extract critical materials from electronic waste while avoiding toxic emissions and reducing environmental impact.

                <p class="description">A deep subsurface thermophilic microbial community from the Naica Mine crystal cave system in Chihuahua, Mexico, representing one of Earth's most extreme oligotrophic deep biosphere habitats. This community thrives in hydrothermal waters at 700-760 m depth with temperatures of 54-60°C, extremely low nutrient availability, and isolation from surface inputs. The prokaryotic community is dominated by chemolithoautotrophic archaea, particularly basal Thaumarchaeota (performing ammonia oxidation) and environmental Thermoplasmatales lineages (Euryarchaeota), with bacterial diversity limited to Candidate Division OP3, Firmicutes, and Alpha/Beta-proteobacteria. High GC content of archaeal and OP3 16S rRNA genes confirms thermophilic adaptation to 50-70°C. Genes encoding archaeal ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) demonstrate that Naica Thaumarchaeota are thermophilic chemolithoautotrophic nitrifiers adapted to extreme energy limitation. The system exhibits astrobiology significance as an analog for subsurface life on Mars and icy moons, with fluid inclusions in giant gypsum crystals potentially harboring ancient microbes for up to 50,000-60,000 years. The absence of detectable eukaryotes reflects the extreme oligotrophy and thermal stress. This natural deep biosphere community provides insights into minimal energy requirements for life, thermophilic adaptation, and survival strategies in isolated subsurface aquifers with extremely limited carbon and nitrogen availability.

                <p class="description">An engineered acidophilic microbial consortium designed for sustainable recovery of platinum group metals (PGMs) from spent automotive catalysts and hydroprocessing catalysts. This bioleaching system employs a two-stage mechanism combining Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for alumina support dissolution with biogenic thiosulfate producers for PGM complexation and mobilization. Spent three-way catalysts (TWC) from automotive exhaust systems contain precious metals (Pt, Pd, Rh) deposited on alumina (Al₂O₃) supports, while spent petroleum refinery hydroprocessing catalysts contain Pd, Ni, Mo, and Al. The consortium operates under acidic conditions in column bioreactors, achieving exceptional recovery rates: 93.2% Pd extraction, 82.9% Ni, 33.4% Al, and 22.7% Mo from spent petroleum catalysts. The bioleaching mechanism proceeds in two stages: (1) At. thiooxidans generates sulfuric acid that dissolves the alumina support matrix, exposing embedded PGM particles, and (2) biogenic thiosulfate (S₂O₃²⁻) produced during sulfur oxidation forms stable complexes with Pd and other PGMs in the presence of copper and ammonia, mobilizing them from the catalyst surface. The thiosulfate-copper-ammonia system enables selective PGM leaching without harsh cyanide reagents. This biotechnological approach offers an environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional pyrometallurgical PGM recovery (high-temperature smelting) and aggressive chemical leaching (aqua regia, cyanide), while addressing circular economy needs for critical materials recovery from automotive and industrial waste streams. The technology represents a significant advance in green metallurgy for spent catalyst recycling.

This community comprises nitrogen-fixing rhizobia (Bradyrhizobium pachyrhizi, Rhizobium species), metal-reducing bacteria, and indigenous microbiota that facilitate phytoremediation of polymetallic tailings containing vanadium (340 mg/kg), titanium, iron, copper, nickel, manganese, and zinc. The Panzhihua deposit has generated approximately 570 million tons of tailing slurries from mining activities, creating a massive contamination challenge requiring sustainable bioremediation. The indigenous microbial community has adapted to extreme metal stress through nitrogen fixation coupled with plant growth promotion, enabling successful legume-based phytoremediation with Pongamia pinnata and Leucaena leucocephala. Bradyrhizobium species demonstrate exceptional heavy metal tolerance while maintaining nitrogen-fixing capacity (increasing plant nitrogen content by 10-145%), promoting plant growth through IAA production, and facilitating metal phytoextraction (enhancing Cu and Ni uptake by 600%). Metal-reducing bacteria contribute to vanadium detoxification through dissimilatory V(V) reduction to less soluble V(IV), decreasing vanadium bioavailability and mobilization risk. The community drives transformation of soil organic carbon, increasing active carbon components and carbon transformation enzymes during revegetation, improving overall tailings soil quality. This system represents a critical model for coupling nitrogen fixation, metal tolerance, and phytoremediation in polymetallic mine tailings, addressing both resource recovery and environmental remediation challenges in the world's largest vanadium-titanium deposit.

This community is dominated by Polaromonas species (Burkholderiaceae family, up to 46% relative abundance in tailings) that perform dissimilatory V(V) reduction using genes homologous to iron and metal reduction pathways (cymA, omcA, narG). The tailings harbor diverse metal-reducing bacteria including sulfate reducers (Desulfovibrio, Desulfitobacterium) and iron-reducing Proteobacteria (Geobacter-related organisms) that contribute to reductive immobilization of vanadium and co-occurring metals. V(V) reduction to V(IV) decreases vanadium solubility by 2-3 orders of magnitude, transforming mobile vanadate into sparingly soluble vanadyl species and V(IV)-containing minerals. The community is enriched from highly contaminated mine tailings with total vanadium concentrations reaching 10,500 mg/kg and bioavailable V(V) at 15-25 mg/L in pore water. Under anaerobic conditions with electron donors (lactate, acetate, hydrogen), the community achieves 60-85% V(V) reduction within 7-14 days. Genes encoding c-type cytochromes (cymA, omcA), nitrate reductases (narG, napA), and arsenate reductases (arrA) mediate V(V) reduction through outer membrane electron transfer pathways. This represents the first demonstration of microbial V(V) reduction in circumneutral pH mine tailings, providing a biological approach for vanadium immobilization and mine remediation. The system is particularly relevant for emerging vanadium contamination from steel production, petroleum processing, and vanadium redox flow battery manufacturing.

The adapted microbial community consists mainly of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (iron-oxidizing) and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans (sulfur-oxidizing), achieving 91% cobalt and 57% copper extraction from bulk tailings (Co 0.02%, Cu 0.12%) after 13 days in stirred tank reactors at 10% pulp density. The consortium exhibits synergistic cooperation between iron and sulfur oxidizers, where iron oxidation by At. ferrooxidans generates ferric iron that chemically oxidizes sulfide minerals, while sulfur oxidation by At. thiooxidans prevents elemental sulfur passivation and maintains low pH through sulfuric acid production. Mineralogical analysis revealed that cobalt occurs on the surface of framboidal pyrite and is mobilized through microbial attack.

The community is strongly dominated by halophilic archaea of the family Halobacteriaceae, with natural brines showing higher archaeal diversity (Halovenus 26.8%, Natronomonas 20.1%, Haloarcula 14%, Halobacterium 13%) compared to concentrated brines where Halovenus becomes even more dominant (41%). Bacterial diversity is phylogenetically richer in concentrated brines, with Rhodothermaceae (represented solely by Salinibacter, 56% in natural brine) being the most abundant bacterial family. The community demonstrates remarkable lithium tolerance and adaptation to chaotropic stress, making it highly relevant for understanding microbial ecology in extreme saline environments and potential biotechnological applications in lithium extraction and critical mineral bioprocessing. Lithium acts as a modulator of microbial richness and diversity, with bacterial diversity increasing and archaeal diversity decreasing as lithium concentration rises during industrial processing.

                <p class="description">A simplified synthetic rhizosphere community (SRC1-subset) derived from the larger SRC1 consortium for enhancing sorghum bioenergy crop productivity. The subset consists of 16-20 bacterial strains selected from the full 57-strain SRC1 community, including multiple Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Arthrobacter strains. This engineered community was designed using network analysis to identify hub taxa and strains capable of utilizing sorghum-specific root exudate compounds. Field-tested studies demonstrate that the community effectively colonizes sorghum rhizosphere and roots, leading to increased shoot biomass and improved yield performance under field conditions. The growth enhancement correlates with transcriptional dampening of lignin biosynthesis in the host plant.

                <p class="description">A moderately thermophilic three-species bioleaching consortium used to study the effects of quorum sensing (QS) signaling on pyrite and chalcopyrite dissolution. This acidophilic community consists of Leptospirillum ferriphilum DSM 14647, Acidithiobacillus caldus DSM 8584, and Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans DSM 9293, operating at pH 2.0-2.5 and 40°C. The consortium demonstrates coordinated microbial behavior mediated by diffusible signal factor (DSF) and N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing systems. Treatment with DSF-family compounds (DSF and BDSF at 2 μM each) reduced pyrite and chalcopyrite dissolution via inhibitory effects on iron oxidation and mineral colonization. DSF compounds induced A. caldus motility and dispersion from pyrite with concomitant expansion of L. ferriphilum on mineral surfaces, while AHL-mediated signaling (C12-AHL, C14-AHL, 3-OH-C12-AHL, 3-OH-C14-AHL at 5 μM each) repressed L. ferriphilum motility. The consortium was subjected to RNA-seq transcriptomics (12 samples, 271 Gbases) to elucidate gene expression changes in response to QS molecules (NCBI BioProject PRJNA1259591). This system represents the first comprehensive study of quorum sensing regulation in moderately thermophilic biomining bacteria, revealing that QS molecules change planktonic/mineral subpopulation distributions and modulate leaching efficiency through control of cell attachment and iron oxidation rates.

                <h2>Tinto River Iron Cycling Community</h2>
                <p class="description">A natural acidic iron-cycling microbial community from the Rio Tinto River in southwestern Spain, distinguished by exceptional eukaryotic diversity (>65% of total biomass) in an extremely acidic environment (mean pH 2.2). While prokaryotic diversity is low with 80% of bacteria belonging to three iron-cycling genera (Leptospirillum, Acidithiobacillus, Acidiphilium), eukaryotic diversity is remarkably high including algae (diatoms, Chlorophyta, Euglenozoa, Rhodophyta), fungi (Hortaea, Acidomyces), and diverse protists (ciliates, amoebae, heliozoans, cercomonads, stramenopiles). The river has constant acidic pH (mean 2.2, range 1.0-2.5) and high metal concentrations (Fe 2.3 g/L, Cu 0.11 g/L, Zn 0.22 g/L) throughout its 100 km length, driven by natural oxidation of massive sulfide deposits in the Iberian Pyrite Belt. The prokaryotic community drives iron cycling through Fe²⁺ oxidation (Leptospirillum, Acidithiobacillus) and heterotrophic carbon cycling (Acidiphilium), creating stromatolite-like iron oxide precipitates. Eukaryotes contribute primary production (photosynthetic algae), heterotrophic consumption (protists, fungi), and trophic structure (ciliate predators, heliozoan top predators). The ecosystem represents a natural analog for early Earth conditions and extraterrestrial iron-rich acidic environments, supporting astrobiology research. Rio Tinto demonstrates that complex food webs with eukaryotic dominance can thrive in extreme acid-metal conditions, challenging assumptions about habitability limits.
